The remainder offers a catered service with large buffet-style cafeterias.

So, after years in Europe (Germany, Switzerland, England...) I try to take care of my home, my studies, my body and my spirits, with the same intensity, in my small farm in Brazil.

For the house, much body work; for studies, books of Nietzsche, Spinoza, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Franz Kafka, etc .; for my body, physical activity and to the spirits, emptiness and silence.

And even before the stricter plan, I live this place with the simplicity of to walter my plants early in the morning, to plant more trees and medicinal plants, cultivate grains and vegetables, take care of the chickens, pigs, and, in the next time, goats and horses. in the evening I'll play football with the village folk and after dinner I'll stand by the door of Mrs Nazare, to talk to the others who always appear there in the afternoon, without thinking about what to do in the next minute.

Ah! I always have time for the music of Janis Joplin, Chico Buarque, etc., play my drums and dance.

If I have guests I'm very happy if they can participate in some of my activities or if I in some of theirs. But it's not the case, I'm happy to allow the comfort of privacy and freedon necessary for a good accomodation.

I expect you'd like to know something about who you're coming to stay with.

I've been hosting on AirBnb since it's beginning in the UK in 2008. I was the fourth host in London and AirBnb has been a huge part of my life since then. I've been in Old Street for the last three years and have had a constant stream of fascinating guests who come to the diverse, creative, metropolitan hub that the ancient ward of Bunhill has become.

The Wesleys founded Methodism here, Daniel Defoe survived and wrote of the plague here. William Blake is buried here as is John Bunyan, ""Pilgrims Progress"".  It truly has been the home of non conformists and dissent for several centuries. It is the algorithm gods who inhabit Bunhill and Clerkenwell today. (Hidden by Airbnb) , Citymapper, (Hidden by Airbnb) and (Hidden by Airbnb) are our neighbours along with hundreds of startups - all of which are going to be ""the big one"".


I'm delighted  to be able to offer you rooms in this beautiful building.Behind the finest terra cotta facade In London you will be staying in one of two beautifully appointed apartments.

One is my home which I love to share with guests and the other belongs to friends who work abroad. I look after both flats, which are very close and I will be your host for your time with us.

I work as a Trade Union representative. I sing Early Music with the Festival Community Choir in  Brighton and in London. at the Charterhouse.

AirBnB makes my life possible. More than that it brings people to my door I would otherwise never meet. I enjoy their stories, their lives,  their experiences and I certainly enjoy eating and drinking with strangers and friends.

My name is Branca, I manage apartments on Airbnb in Shoreditch, London.

I enjoy hosting guests, it is lovely meeting people from all over the world and I really like to hear that the guests are having a lovely time in London.

All the apartments I manage are on Brick Lane in Shoreditch. It is a great place to stay: very vibrant with many markets, restaurants, bars nearby and the highest concentration of Indian restaurants anywhere in the world. It is also only a 5 minute walk to Liverpool St station and the City.

Kitted out with stylish furniture and modern art, the apartments also have hard wood floors, exposed original brick walls and ultra-modern Italian kitchens & bathrooms; all have been completely refurbished from February 2016.  

Stays include coffee, tea, chocolates and complimentary bathroom toiletries.

The area has been helped by excellent travel links – the DLR and Jubilee Line takes you into the City and West End in 10 to 15 minutes, and are two of the most salubrious modes of public transport in London. Canary Wharf and its surroundings are now home not only to billion pound businesses, but also a rapidly growing number of professional residents.

Welcome to my profile,  just an introduction about me;

I am based in London and I love playing piano and am a general lover of art music, traveling, reading and the odd visit to the theater when I have time.

Having visited many Air BNB's around the world, I felt it was time to offer my apartments to travelers wishing to explore the historic City of London.

I can help travelers with tickets for the Theatre, London sports events (football, rugby, boxing) and any music concerts happening in the Capital :)

All of my apartments have recently been refurbished and as a host I can be available when needed and i also have a team on hand in the unlikely event a situation arises and they can be contacted via (Hidden by Airbnb) for a rapid response.

Hopefully meet you soon!

Friends and family loved staying there for the fantastic Paris views and the location – walking distance to cafés, landmarks and wonderful shops. We have a passion for sharing “la vie Parisienne”—the Parisian lifestyle—and that passion fueled the creation of our boutique vacation rental company. Our goal is to help you fall in love with Paris while discovering, exploring, tasting and savoring new sights and experiences in the incredible City of Light!

You invest a lot to come to Paris and we want you to enjoy every minute, from the moment you wake up in the morning and buy buttery warm croissants around the corner to enjoying a glass of wine and watching the sunset behind the Eiffel Tower. What makes our apartments unique is that they’re beautifully decorated, welcoming and located in the best and safest locations in Paris. A friendly English-speaking greeter provides a warm welcome, to answer questions and help you feel at home.

Despite being catnip for visitors, much of this stretch of central London – the ministries that line Whitehall as well as the heavily guarded, security-gated Downing Street – is strictly off-limits. But there is still plenty to do and see around Westminster. As well as tours of these famous sites, there’s St James’s Park, which is essentially the Queen’s front garden. Between The Mall and Piccadilly also lies the genteel neighbourhood of St James’s, characterised by luxury hotels and some of London’s oldest shops.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/5acf15ea-0545-4225-b6bd-7e842d446ba2.jpg,273701605,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/273701605,Mark,2019-07-05,"England, United Kingdom","Hey Airbnb'ers!

My heart is invested in real charity. I co-run charitable endeavours in emerging countries that seek to build schools and hospitals, as well provide widows and orphans with vocational skills. I give consultative pro bono advice to London community libraries and the unrepresented. I channel my love of sport to run, cycle and row for MacMillan and St Luke's hospice.

Great neighbourhood and links to other parts fo the city. Wonderful, helpful neighbours, local grocery stores with delicious produce, well priced. This is my home so it has a whole host of personal touches. I have been an air bnb host before, at a different place - see reviews. I love this place even more! It has really lovely features, like beautiful wooden floors and tiled bathroom.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />The flat is in a Victorian house which has been split into two so, although it's a flat, it is spacious and has lovely high ceilings. The front door is thick and heavy so great for security. You enter the flat through the living room where there is a bay window so lots of light. there's a 3 seater sofa - very comfy - and an arm chair. There are lots of blankets for snuggling up, too. The bedroom is a spacious double and has drawers for storage. Under the bed is more linen and towels ","The flat is close to everything you might need! There are lots of grocery shops within a minutes walk which are well priced and sell a range of food and lots of other things you might need. There is a large supermarket about 20 minutes walk away for anything else. I am close to the popular Walthamstow village and Clapton - both really fun areas with great restaurants and bars.<br />One of the things I love most about my area is the huge amount of green space, despite it being urban. Wanstead Flats are a bus ride away where it's pretty rugged and wild. Epping Forest is about 20 minutes away by car/taxi if you want something a bit bigger to walk through. There's lots of little parks close by, too. One of my personal favourites is Hackney Marshes where you can wander along the canal and pop into buzzing bars and cafes along the way.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-53552186/original/e70b5d9b-0633-4f16-bfd6-fb565d1b5255.jpeg,13490587,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/13490587,Ellie,2014-03-24,"London, United Kingdom","I'm a teacher working in London.
