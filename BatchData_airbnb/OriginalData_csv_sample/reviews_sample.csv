15400,21032,2009-12-21,53815,Hailey,"We loved staying at Phillipa's place in Chelsea. The flat was lovely, and the neighborhood was great. Lots of fun shops, and close to two metro stops. We would love to stay there again!"
15400,109674,2010-10-02,148145,Garth,"A comfortable apartment conveniently located near shops, restaurants and tube stations. <br/>Philippa is a very helpful and friendly hostess. We would recommend her and her apartment to anyone.<br/>Thank you Philippa for an enjoyable holiday."
15400,120941,2010-10-17,112795,Cédric,"I really enjoyed my week at Philippa's, the place is ideally situated in Chelsea, and she is a very kind host, I would definitely recommend that you stay there, I will again without any doubt. "
15400,192035,2011-03-04,308956,Rob,"I am a little late reviewing this but it is important to me that I do.  Look, the place is in a great location and the neighbor was very friendly.  The place was perfectly comfortable and Philippa gave a lot of helpful information prior to our arrival in England.<br/><br/>However, me and my girlfriend were robbed the second night we were there.  We went out to meet friends and by the time we got back, all of our valuables were taken (computers, iPods, camera equipment, jewelry, etc).  It was upon the arrival of the police that we learned two things:<br/>1)  Rooms here are rented out very, very frequently.  There are always people in and out so it is very obvious that there are tourists coming in and out of here.<br/>2) The locks, as explained by the police, are very inadequate at this location and can be circumvented with extremely simple tactics.<br/><br/>The most aggravating part of this was how we were treated.  We followed all instructions exactly as they were laid out and were very deliberate in making sure everything was perfectly secure as we went in and out of the place.  However, all correspondence with Philippa (through email or through her neighbor) indicated nothing other than it somehow being our fault.  There was very little sympathy and all the commentary centered around what WE did.  Additionally, Philippa basically just stopped replying to emails after we expressed how frustrated we were from her responses and the lack of security and safety in the building.<br/><br/>So, it is a nice place and a convenient location, but the threat of robbery (or God forbid attacks) is just simply too high here."
15400,219843,2011-04-07,427875,Maria,"Very nice flat, and extremely well-located. Great for couples and single travelers. It is small and notes in the lobby indicate that the neighbors don't take kindly to noise--if you are a large family or group, this is probably not the place for you.<br/><br/>Philippa herself was a great host--I very much enjoyed meeting her. She left a great selection of helpful tourist info. "
15400,229267,2011-04-17,472341,Lisa,"This is a superior option to staying at a hotel in London, especially when considering the price of London hotels.  <br/><br/>The place is located in lovely Chelsea, seconds away from scores of shops, restaurants and pubs.  There is also a supermarket and cinema literally right around the corner.  If your only in London a few days and are primarily sight-seeing, the place is within walking distance to two metro stations and two or three tube stops to Westminister, Soho and Southbank  (about 20 mins total time).   A really great option for quick and easy access to central London with a quieter, trendy and less tourist neighbourhood to come home too.  And for anyone traveling from North America, London public transit is an absolute dream in comparison.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is very cute, perfectly clean and very well out-fitted.  Everything was recieved exactly as promised in the ad.  Phillipa was a kind and helpful host.  We would definitely recommend this place.  Great visit!"
15400,242805,2011-04-27,505370,Lorena,"Within less than 10 minutes of South Kensington and 15 minutes of Sloane Square tube stations, there are several buses even closest to the apartment such as line 14, 19 and 11 (if I remember well). Some of the buses run all night so if you want to go out and are a little low on money for the cab you can always take one f them to go home!<br/>It is ideal if you want to do some sightseeing and party in London while living in a nice and calm area. Of course you'll have to be very quiet while coming back home because it is a residential area and that's what make it so nice. <br/>Lovely shop stores around on King's road, the Saatchi gallery is at 10 minutes walking, the grocery store is literally  around the corner.<br/>Saint-Pancras station for those who take the Eurostar is in the same tube station at 45 minutes top. Most of the tourist spots are within 20 minutes.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is very quiet at night a little less in the morning because it is located next to a store delivery parking. No worries then close the windows turn on the air conditioner or put some ear plugs if you are like me (light sleeper) it only lasts an hour.<br/><br/>It is exactly as indicated in the add. Beautiful natural light that makes it very bright. Comfortable bed, clean bathroom with fresh towels and toilet paper (seems silly to point it but very useful when you arrive late and haven't got time to go to the market) and an equipped kitchen. Everything you need for your stay as a true Londoner!<br/><br/>Philippa is a very lovely and warm lady. I am sure she will make your stay as comfortable as ours. <br/>I am glad I've met her and I hope next time I'll go to London her appartment will be free for me to rent it! <br/><br/>Thank you again for everything Philippa!! :) "
15400,458003,2011-08-19,565629,Lim,"Wonderful location! 10min stroll to the tube and as we found out, fantastic bus connections to lots of sightseeing spots of London. <br/>Having a well equipped kitchen and waitrose supermarket next door helps to whip up a good meal in pricy London. <br/>Apartment is clean and cozy. <br/>Philippa is very helpful and very welcoming. <br/>Highly recommend her apartment to all visitors looking to enjoy London for short and long stays. "
15400,488228,2011-08-30,928894,Jennifer,"Located in a convenient and central area of London, this flat is the perfect place for tourists looking for an affordable home base. Close to 2 tube stops and several bus lines, the flat is close to great shops and in a nice residential area. You'll have to be respectful of your neighbors if coming in late at night or early in the morning but it also means a peaceful time for yourself. The amenities and apartment are just as the photos and description indicate. The host is very helpful and accommodating. I'd love to stay here again on a return trip to London! "
15400,528262,2011-09-13,969713,Valerie,"Delightful, charming hostess.  Very clean, and wonderful neighborhood.  Only one bus to the city, lots of amenities nearby, very safe area, great pubs nearby, went for evening walks, great coffee shop in the morning....Thanks Philippa!"
15400,553595,2011-09-21,859564,S M,"The flat is exactly as it is shown in the photographs.<br/>My flight in was very late; but Philippa was there to meet me at the flat; and seems a very good hostess.<br/>As I was traveling alone, it was nice to know that she lives nearby for added security.<br/>The building is quite secure, and the flat itself has very good locks; and also locking windows with a little separate key.<br/>Even being on the ground floor, I felt very safe there.<br/>I didn't mind the street noise at all, as we live on a busy street at home.<br/>The bedroom has lovely thick curtains, so you can get a great sleep in the very comfy bed ,and not be woken up by light in the mornings.<br/>The flat is spotless throughout, and has lots of hot water for showers.<br/>It's got absolutely everything you would need; from hairdryer to iron, to all the kitchen equipment needed for cooking.<br/>It's really easy to get around London from there : <br/>I recommend buying an Oyster Transport pass for the Tube and buses. <br/>I was even able to use it on a couple of regular trains.<br/>Lots of great shops right nearby, including a wonderful large grocery store.<br/>This was my first experience with AirBnB, though I always rent apartments when I travel;  and I was VERY pleased with it all.<br/>Thanks, Philippa ;  for sharing your cosy home with others!<br/>I would love to stay there on another visit!<br/>"
15400,635891,2011-10-17,196656,Virginia,"Philippa is a wonderful host and a most charming woman - the apartment was lovely, the location perfect, the stay was completely hassle and problem free and I look forward to returning as soon as I can."
15400,680472,2011-11-01,495545,Alessia,"My parents came to London and needed a place to stay. I booked Philippa's apartment because I loved the position and the pictures on Airbnb. <br/>I arrived a day before my parents and went to Philippa to do the check in. She was amazing! So kind! <br/>The flat was super clean and tidy and very welcoming. I loved it at first glance!<br/>I recommend the flat because has an extraordinary position ( it's in the heart of Chelsea, in Kings road!!!) and Philippa is an amazing host.<br/>I definitely will rent again the flat in future!"
15400,864326,2012-01-16,583352,Carollyn,this is a wonderful little bolt hole in the lovely area of Chelsea - very conveniently located near Kings Road and lots of public transport. Highly recommended for short or medium stays. Thanks Phillipa.
15400,1027529,2012-03-21,1767934,Melanie,I enjoyed my stay at Phillipa's apartment.  It was within easy walking distance to the underground station and was in an attractive and upmarket part of London.  It was a bonus having Waitrose supermarket in the next street.  Although I didn't get to meet Phillipa ( she was overseas) I had regular contact with her and she was concerned that I had a pleasant stay and everything I needed.  I would recommend  the apartment for both a long or short term stay in London. <br/>Melanie Brown
15400,1064020,2012-03-31,1775383,Brando,"We had a wonderful stay in Philippa's apartment. Comfortable, quiet and very clean. The aparment is in a very nice location with all types of restaurants and a Waitrose supermarket right around the corner. In a few minutes you can walk to the river, over the bridge and into Battersea park! <br/><br/>I didn't get a chance to meet Philippa in person as she was abroad, but she was very friendly and helpful over the phone and via email. We had everything we needed and it was a real pleasure to stay there. Thank you Philippa! "
15400,1354646,2012-05-27,1262848,Tony,"As a solo mature aged traveller wanting to spend some time in London, it was perfect. location  as  it is a short walk (about 12 mins) to South Kensington underground which gives you access to 3 main train lines Piccadilly, District and (Website hidden by Airbnb) is also just of Kings Roads in Chelsea giving you access to everything you need for your stay in London including supermarkets,eateries, post office and a great pub around the corner called the Builders Arms. Everything for me was perfect in the apartment. Nothing was not available that I needed. Philippa is a wonderful host and had prepared the apartment ready for easy access. Everything was explained and all easy to use. I felt very secure in the apartment which is very light and airy. For me it was my perfect choice for my stay in London, made even more enjoyable in having Philippa as your host who certainly has a great apartment for one or 2 people. Many thanks. Philippa as greatly appreciate the opportunity of staying in your Chelsea pad. It is perfect"
15400,1491714,2012-06-16,2384243,José Henrique,"We've been traveling to <br/>london every year, it was our first time in Philippa's flat and it was great. Everything is perfect and the location.... We loved! Thank you Philippa!!"
15400,1613474,2012-07-02,215772,Jason,"Very nice flat  with a lot of amenities, and it's very quiet! I stayed here for a couple of days this summer and would definitely stay again. <br/><br/>Philippa was a bit hard to reach via phone / email at times, but I think I just caught her while she was doing some heavy traveling. Overall the trip worked out well and both she and Mary (a local tenant) were quite accommodating! "
15400,1718338,2012-07-16,2387745,Silvia,"El departamento esta muy bien ubicado y equipado.<br/>La persona que nos recibio, fue muy amable en indicarnos donde ir a comprar comida en el horario que llegamos. Y Philipa nos permitio dejar nuestras valijas mas tarde del horario de salida.<br/>Tiene un gran defecto que es el ruido de camiones en la semana, muy temprano por la mañana, ya que hay un negocio de muebles a la vuelta y los camiones estacionan justo en la calle a la que da la habitacion y hacen mucho ruido.<br/>El sillon cama no es muy comodo para descansar.<br/>Me resulto algo incomodo que Philippa llegue al departamento sin aviso previo, y que revise todo, nunca me paso algo asi, no se si es algo comun en Londres, pero he alquilado mas departamentos en otras ciudades, y eso me resulto algo molesto y extraño."
15400,1789153,2012-07-24,382420,Ruth,"What a wonderful first time London experience! From the very beginning Philippa, our host, was informative, helpful and open. Philippa was unable to meet us but Mary her friend and neighbor helped us settle iin and offered us umbrellas for our rainy stay.<br/><br/>The apartment was wonderfully located with a supermarket, pastry shops and so many restaurants within walking distance, ie just around the corner. Ditto for public transportation - bus stop just around the corner that served us as ""tour"" buses since the routes went by every known site you could wish to visit. Within walking distance the Victoria and Albert museum and the Natural history musuem, the beautiful church of St. Luke with its gardens just at the end of the street.<br/><br/>And the apartment itself was incredibly comfortable, with a washing machine and dishwasher and enough kitchen utensils for breakfast or any other meal you would want to prepare.<br/><br/>The neighborhood was exceptionally  quiet  in the evening with only the routine morning noise of the city of London waking in the morning.<br/><br/>I recommend Philippa and her home  very highly and hope to return quite soon.<br/><br/>Ruth"
15400,2140878,2012-08-30,164949,Carla,"Thank you for letting us stay in your beautiful flat. The location was excellent; you can almost see the bus stop from the front door! There is also plenty of shopping close by. The only tiny complaint we had was that apartment was on the first floor and it could be a little loud in the mornings. If you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. But I would definitely recommend this place!"
15400,2228512,2012-09-08,2664072,Katherine,"Just as pictured - tidy, comfortable and quiet, with a nice bathroom, a well stocked kitchen, and a washer/dryer/ironing board/iron which is wonderful if you opt to stay a full week or more. With a Waitrose and an M&S both just around the corner, you'll be all set!<br/><br/>It's an incredibly convenient location - just off King's Road, only 10 min. walk to the South Kensington stop (near the V&A and within walking distance of Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park, etc.) and ~10-15 min. walk to Sloan Square.  Philippa was also an excellent host, always very helpful and responsive.<br/><br/>We only wish we'd been able to stay another week. A wonderful value, and I'm sure we'll try to stay again the next time we're in London!"
15400,2298601,2012-09-16,2603702,Deva,"The apartment was lovely and exactly as promised. We found the location excellent -- convenient to bus and tube, with lots of shops nearby-- and all the appliances and furnishings excellent. Phillipa made checking in and out a breeze, and kindly left us some milk in the fridge, and made certain we understood how everything worked.<br/><br/>The only drawbacks are things the owner really couldn't control: the noise from the trucks unloading right outside in the mornings (not too bad with windows closed), and the resulting lack of air circulation at night. <br/><br/>I would certainly recommend this flat to a couple looking for a clean, comfortable, well-equipped rental at a great price and in a great location!"
15400,2425906,2012-09-27,733596,LaValle,"The Bright Chelsea Apartment was just that. The flat is exactly as advertised ~ compact yet complete with everything you might need. Both of us arrived from Amsterdam a day into head colds. Philippa was kind enough to direct us to the ""electric fire"" she keeps tucked away so we were able to be a bit warmer on our sickest day.<br/><br/>Philippa is a great host making certain we knew where everything was and how it operated in the flat. We enjoyed being on the ground level for a change. Usually our accommodations  away from home seem to be on the fifth and sixth floors without lifts.<br/><br/>Philippa will be starting a remodeling soon so it wil be interesting to stay when she has completed that to see the changes. They undoubtedly will be stunning.<br/><br/>Special note: I needed to fax a document back to the States and asked Philippa about businesses that provided those such as FedEx and MailBoxes Etc. There is a MBE near the South Kensington Underground however Philippa advised that her printer should do that (wouldn't connect for me as a scanner but worked fine as a copier/printer). The alternative were free services at the Town Hall across Kings Road. I ended up at the library at that building. William helped me join the library and then made an appointment for me at the computer station that would scan my document so I could send it as an attachment to an email.<br/><br/>"
15400,3290846,2013-01-06,1457643,Alexander,"Philippa was a very friendly, warm and caring host. We arrived very early - which meant that the guest before us was still in the flat, so Pilippa showed as a nice British bar/restaurant and had (very early ;) ) lunch with us - thanks for that! :) The room was very clean, big enough for the two of us and very easy to reach via bus and metro. You need about 20 minutes by bus and about 10 minutes by metro to get to the center. <br/><br/>We can only recommend this flat as accommodation and Philippa as a host!"
15400,3679074,2013-03-03,3726941,Natalie,"Philippa's flat in Chelsea is absolutely adorable. It is warm, cosy, welcoming, and simply a delightful space. In a marvellous location; a secure building;  I had a most enjoyable stay. Thank you so much!"
15400,4433523,2013-05-05,5673969,Simon & Lili,"great flat, super location, nice and cosy, would definitely stay there again!"
15400,4508225,2013-05-09,4619109,Olivier & Josiane,Every thing was fine!<br/>Great location in Chelsea! We had no problem getting the key. We had a great time and would be very likely to recommend this flat. <br/>Regards
15400,4662409,2013-05-19,2461921,Dylan,"Great little flat, central location, everything works."
15400,8175572,2013-10-19,1631583,Brad,A wonderful location. Philippa's home has everything you need & is very comfortable...feels like home. Thanks again.
15400,8539696,2013-11-04,9500288,Tom,"Our first and very positive airbnb experience. The apt. was exactly as pictured on airbnb. No surprises and no disappointments. On arrival was clean and tidy. Key exchange went smoothly. Cozy but plenty of space for two people. Everything worked. WiFi was excellent.Communication via email with Phillipa was effortless. Location is great with easy access to stores, restaurants, buses and  underground. Neighborhood was quiet and safe. Highly recommended. Would definitely stay there again."
15400,8967459,2013-11-29,9235247,Dorothy B,"Wonderful location just off the Kings Rd. The flat was spotless, nicely decorated, good internet, comfy bed, plenty of hot water,small, but very well equipped kitchen. Good ground floor location so no need to lug luggage up stairs for us elderly folk. Philippa was a great host- answered all my questions promptly. Hope to stay there again."
15400,9561117,2014-01-02,10536261,Alison,We had a very comfortable stay in Chelsea Manor Street. Close to transport and all the things we wanted to do. Really nice to feel that we were at home. Philippa was overseas when we were there but arranged key pickup and answered our questions promptly. 
15400,9854993,2014-01-14,10602959,Vasily,It was a great two week spend at the place. Great location and everything you need to fell boom away from home.
15400,9925873,2014-01-20,4293299,Vera,"Lovely apartment, great location, clean. Nice area, King's Road round the corner. 2 Minutes to busstop. Hardly any traffic in the street. Some noise early in the morning (Waitrose is very near), but it would be difficult to find a more quiet place so central in London. Good communication with Philippa."
15400,12109023,2014-04-23,3918812,Rachel,"This Chelsea apartment is a great place for visiting London. It is perfectly located, with King's Road shops around the corner, buses going in all directions, and half way between two tube stations.<br/>The apartment is sunny and cosy and very easy to live in.<br/>Philippa is just an email away. It is a secure building.<br/>We toured all over London from here."
15400,13308190,2014-05-25,13367361,Louise,"First time on Airbnb,<br/><br/>Philippa was very kind, welcoming and accomodating.<br/>The flat is lovely, and as clean and quiet as said in the comments.<br/>The location was perfect, next to underground station on the main lines.<br/><br/>We had there a wonderful time, and would be happy to stay there again !"
15400,13700395,2014-06-02,15528928,Gary,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I can only hope that future rentals are this positive. <br/><br/>Excellent apartment and exactly as described in the listing, down to the nice pub around the corner and the very relaxing gardens at St. Luke's. Safe, vibrant neighborhood and the location can't be beat. Bus stops right around the corner, underground stations a 3 minute bus ride or 10 minute walk away. Full service market also right around the corner. Several eating choices within a short walk.  The apartment was warm and cozy and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. <br/><br/>Philippa was an outstanding host. Once we booked she provided us a wealth of information on the apartment and the neighborhood to get us orientated and despite the late hour of our arrival she was there to meet us and get us settled. The apartment has internet and Philippa had a number of maps and guides to help plan our London vacation. If relaxing with a good book is on the agenda, she has a nice assortment to choose from. <br/><br/>All-in-all a five star experience. I would not hesitate to recommend Philippa's apartment to my friends. <br/><br/><br/> "
15400,13993907,2014-06-09,8277303,Rokas,"Nice host, tidy and well-equipped apartment, great location."
15400,14921686,2014-06-29,16199237,Robert,"This was our first BnB experience and we were very pleased.  The apartment was clean and comfortable and the owner was very friendly and helpful.  A delightful lady from upstairs made our stay more enjoyable and managed a maintenance issue while we were out.  Location was excellent, directly on the bus lines and short walks to two tube stations.  Many food/pub choices minutes away and the Waitrose market was just around the corner.  We felt totally comfortable with the neighborhood and although we were on a first floor, it was actually very quiet and we slept well.  Starts to get a little noisy some mornings at 8, but we were well on on way to heading out for the morning.  We appreciated the absolute absence of smoke in the apartment.  I can easily recommend this apartment and location to anyone!"
15400,15264060,2014-07-06,11959525,Michael,"Philippa’s little apartment was perfect for my week’s stay in London. Very well located and very accessible to public transport, pubs and restaurants. All amenities were readily at hand. If only I had realised that there was an air conditioning unit above front door before my last days stay, especially as London probably experienced its hottest days of the summer during my stay! I would certainly recommend this apartment and hope to stay there on my next London trip. Mike"
15400,17088763,2014-08-07,12970089,Andrew,A small flat off the Kings Road in Chelsea which we took for a month.  Probably a bit small for a full month (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minutes walk from Sloane Square it is a good position save for one glaring fault.  It is on the corner of Hemus Place (see (Hidden by Airbnb) street view) which contains the loading docks and delivery areas for Habitat and Waitrose and the trucks can start form 6:00 AM some mornings and 7:00 AM most!  A sleep in is not an option. A minor but inconvenient matter was the dish washer was non functional when we arrived and as the owner was overseas nothing could be done.    Generally satisfactory!
15400,23566366,2014-12-05,2984861,Roy,"A wonderful place to stay in London! It was easy to get to anywhere in London, situated between South Kensington and Sloane Square Tube stops. The first day we walked from the apartment to Westminister Abbey and Parliament. We loved the area, the walk along Kings Rd was one we did often and will miss. The flat was well appointed and Philippa gave us a thorough introduction to everything in the apartment before she left. Great food stores nearby, Waitrose and M&S.  If we go back to London we would want to stay here again. "
15400,27598311,2015-03-08,6608797,Shannon,"Philippa is a lovely hostess and very accommodating. The flat was just as described, and was perfect for my 2-week venture in London. Philippa's flat is very comfortable and private, and close to all amenities. I would definitely recommend it as a great place to stay while exploring London. "
15400,28046390,2015-03-16,102375,Andrew,"Nice friendly welcome from Philippa, great compact flat in good location."
15400,29497446,2015-04-08,28190119,Henry,"As previously arranged, we contacted Philippa when we arrived at the neighborhood Tube Station in London, and then met her in person at her flat just a few minutes later. She gave us a very thorough introduction to all aspects such as Kitchen, laundry, garbage, etc and welcomed any questions that we had. The flat and location were exactly as described in the listing, and, in fact, exceeded it.  "
15400,32758978,2015-05-21,7318364,Maria,Great flat and perfectly placed! Philippa was wonderful and explained everything in detail. We felt very welcome and safe there.
15400,34004222,2015-06-03,16233502,Stephanie,"The flat is very comfortable, clean and in a wonderful area. We felt (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Philippa was easy and she was very helpful and accommodating. We had a great stay."
15400,34331228,2015-06-07,7002325,Katherine,"This is a perfect location for museums the V and A and the Natural History Museum. The 211 bus got me to Victoria Station in minutes; everything I needed close by - truly a comfortable, safe and pleasant venue for my solo city break. "
15400,35608823,2015-06-20,22851074,Michael,"Phillipa's apartment is clean, comfortable, well equipped, filled with natural light, and very well located. Very suitable for 1 person or a couple. As other reviewers have noted, it is behind the loading docks of two shops BUT double glazed windows throughout and heavy curtains in the bedroom minimised noise and light, with no problem for me on a morning I wished to sleep in. With a fan in the bedroom, air conditioning in the central hall and heating throughout, this would be a comfortable choice in any season. Ground floor location gives it convenient access with the Kings Rd - and buses - within 2 min. walk and tube within 12 min walk. "
15400,36030481,2015-06-24,4534043,Karah,Philippa's apartment was wonderful!! It was cozy and charming and in the best location. Communication with her was perfect and we found the place easily. She provided detailed instructions for everything in the apartment. We felt very at home. 
15400,37766478,2015-07-10,4443388,Udatta,"We booked the flat for 4 days in early July. Communication with Phillipa was excellent prior to our arrival. Unfortunately, we did not meet either Phillipa or any other person during our stay. Fortunately, we were able to get to the keys and successfully enter the apartment. The apartment itself was nice and comfortable. The location has its good and bad points. First the good - because of its location near a lot of nice shopping and restaurants (including a supermarket, Waitrose, nearby) our stay was comfortable. The number 11 bus which stops nearby takes you to within 15 minutes walking of most major sights. The bad thing about the location is it is right behind the Waitrose. ON our first morning we were woken up early by a lot of delivery truck noise. The dumpsters nearby are also a bit of an eyesore. But we kept the curtains drawn and were out most of the day so those things were soon forgotten. Overall we were pleased with our stay. "
15400,38136941,2015-07-13,3321262,Beth Ann,"We had a wonderful stay at Philippa's cozy flat. It was perfectly located for our purposes, close to transportation, very comfortable, clean and easy to feel at home. <br/>In terms of what matters to us, the kitchen had what we needed, the shower was strong, the bed comfortable, and the AC worked well. <br/>Communication with Philippa was pleasant, instructions were clear, and Mary was very nice when we arrived later than expected due to tube strike. <br/>All in all, a terrific experience. We would definitely stay again and recommend highly to others. <br/>Thank you, Philippa!"
15400,39030382,2015-07-20,35433985,Kathleen,"Philippa was very responsive to all communication and very thorough in her descriptions about how everything worked. She was not in the country during our stay but it is pretty much a turn key operation and there was a neighbor who we could have contacted if necessary. The apartment is as pictured and described on the website. Great neighborhood with excellent shopping dining and lots of pubs and clubs. little bit of a walk to the subway, but there are buses, taxis and uber so we had no trouble getting around. The apartment has all of the conveniences you could need or want. Dishwasher, washer and dryer and Air conditioning unit and all worked flawlessly. We would definitely stay here again."
15400,40096686,2015-07-28,15031078,Tricia,Our stay of 6 days in London at Philippa's apartment was very successful. The Apartment was as advised and being just off Kings Road was ideal. We would definitely use it again.  
15400,66557008,2016-03-23,8657262,Kirsten,"I had an excellent stay in Philippa's flat. Although she was away when we arrived, she made arrangements for us to acquire the keys and receive a tour of the apartment. The flat is so cute, perfect for 1 or a couple.<br/><br/>The apartment is located in a lovely neighbourhood, with many excellent bars and restaurants as well as 2 underground stations within in walking distance. We had no issues getting around the city while staying based in Chelsea."
15400,69724613,2016-04-12,27385446,Andrew,"I stayed in Philippa's apartment for a week while in London on business. The apartment was perfect for me. It had everything I wanted, it was very clean and tidy, the shower was terrific, it was handy to public transport, it was on the ground floor but very safe and secure. I will certainly try to stay here the next time I am in London."
15400,76869648,2016-05-29,51941207,Kurt,The flat is amazing. Its close to the bus stop and just a minute walk to all the pubs. I would recommend this apartment to anyone who want to stay in Chelsea. 
15400,82154888,2016-06-26,4785780,Kelly,"Good communication prior to arrival and Phillipa was there to welcome us despite late plane. Our second stay at her apt. Great location close to two tube stations, restaurants, shopping and a grocery store around the corner if you want to cook. Fully equipped. Beautiful little church park at the end of the street. Great place from which to explore London. "
15400,88973916,2016-07-26,1444416,Melanie,"I cannot recommend this flat highly enough. It was lovely, clean, easy check-in and -out, excellent location; everything you could hope for. Honestly, stop your search and stay here. It's the perfect slice of London life and British hospitality provided by Philippa. "
15400,93909724,2016-08-14,86225506,Ruhi,Perfectly located to explore London city at its best!
15400,97704669,2016-08-28,20856348,Cristina,"I loved my 6-night stay at this adorable apartment! It's compact but just right for just one person. It was also an extremely convenient 2-minute walk to my office along with a variety of shops, restaurants, and pubs. The ground floor location was a bit strange at first, as I felt that people on the street could see me in the apartment, but it ended up not being an issue (just make sure to close the curtains when you need to). It also can get a little noisy, but my sleep wasn't very disturbed. Overall, a tremendous value for apartment quality and location."
15400,99131049,2016-09-03,59200541,Natalia Sol,"It was a very nice stay. The apartment is exactly as described and has everything you could possibly need. We didn't get to meet Philippa but we could communicate and arrange everything for our arrival and departure. The  shower pressure was really good, we had lots of towels and the kitchen was more than fully equiped. There's a supermarket just around the corner which is great. The street is a bit noisy sometimes early in the morning. We would definitely choose this apartment again if we visited London."
15400,101139155,2016-09-12,18263861,Sharlane,"You MUST stay here! I cannot recommend this place enough. Communication with Philippa before we arrived was great, and the instructions to get into the flat were simple and clear. After we arrived, we received a welcome e-mail from her, and although she was not in London at the time, we were able to reach out to her neighbour if we needed anything (which we did not). The flat had everything we needed, and was the perfect size for a couple. It was on the ground floor, which was a bit nerve-wracking at first, but we were able to close the curtains and felt very safe and secure in the building. <br/><br/>Chelsea is a very posh area and we felt very safe, even when coming home at 1AM in the morning one night. It is close to so many restaurants, great shopping, and is a 10 minute walk from the tube. It was also a great home base for sightseeing - we frequently only had to take one line (Circle/District) to get where we needed to go. <br/><br/>I would definitely stay here again."
15400,101988349,2016-09-16,91648685,Mike,"A wonderful find, just off the King's Road. Compact but with everything that you possibly want and more. What's more, the host kept in touch to the extent that she was mid Atlantic when she became aware of the heat wave we were enjoying and e-mailed me to remind me of the air conditioning unit. Service indeed. Would I stay there again? Yes! Would I recommend it to friends? Ofcourse!"
15400,107551873,2016-10-10,36253984,Carmel,"We knew the area well, so knew how convenient the location is. Everything at your fingertips. <br/>There was a bit of noise during the day with local construction, but we were out most of the day so it wasn't an issue. The flat is small but cute, and had everything you would need. Highly recommend. "
15400,108051657,2016-10-14,92858307,Mary Lou,"What a great location! Super convenient, clean with a comfortable bed, luxurious linens and a super host. Our only regret is that we didn't get to meet Philippa as she was traveling- but she has a great system for check-in when she is traveling. We felt safe in the neighborhood and found a great breakfast place a few steps away... Nells. Tell them ""San Diego"" sent you!!"
15400,109100609,2016-10-19,96743710,Carlos Roberto,"En general fue una buena experiencia, las llaves estaban donde se indicó, llegamos bien con la dirección y el lugar tiene lo que ofrece.<br/>Excelente ubicación, tranquilo y seguro."
15400,109863197,2016-10-23,35019564,Laurent Et Stéphanie,"Un superbe séjour : l'appartement est idéalement situé car  les bus passants à l'arrêt situé à quelques mètres desservent la station de métro de Sloan Square mais ont aussi un accès direct et rapide à Picadilly Circus, Victoria Station et bien d'autres lieux stratégiques. La station de métro Sloan Square étant sur la circle line est très pratique. King's Road est une rue commerçante animée, on peut manger dans des restos très sympas dans les environs proches. Le quartier chic est vraiment idéal.<br/>L'appartement est très agréable, très coquet, la déco est jolie et la propreté est absolument impeccable. Philippa s'est montrée très réactive et prévenante dans ses messages, ainsi que de bons conseils. Elle ne nous a pas reçus à l'arrivée mais les explications étaient suffisantes pour que nous puissions nous installer confortablement. Une gentille attention nous attendait dans l'appartement. Tout a été vraiment parfait hormis un peu bruit la nuit et au petit matin (plaque de fer sur laquelle roulent les voitures à cause de travaux, service de livraison du magasin Habitat juste à coté, camions poubelles) dus au fait qu'on se situait au rdc, qui nous ont parfois réveillés. Néanmoins j'y retournerais avec plaisir et recommande grandement cet appartement. Merci Philippa. "
15400,121474840,2016-12-17,95753120,James,This place is perfect for someone needing a home away from home. It is very convenient to everything in Chelsea and Kensington

15400,140874646,2017-04-01,118235523,Carsten,"Beliggenhed, beliggenhed og beliggenhed. Centralt i Chelsea, med god adgang til Londons centrum via  bus eller tube."
15400,154393318,2017-05-24,51941207,Kurt,"Beautiful place, close to everything!! "
15400,164644012,2017-06-28,100840491,Tim,Excellent host. Convenient and comfortable apartment. I will plan future trips here if possible.
15400,168732943,2017-07-10,28357890,Kelly,Philippa was lovely and the flat's location was excellent - so close to the shops on the King's Road and an easy walk to the Tube. It's the perfect base for a solo traveler or a couple. 
15400,200432130,2017-10-05,62297519,Lisa,"Philippa's flat is amazing!  So close to the bus, tube, grocery store and restaurants.  Very comfortable, fabulous amenities, and easy check in.  We would definitely stay at her place again."
15400,202250528,2017-10-10,22027723,Timothy,We enjoyed every bit of our stay at Philippa's apartment. The location affords quick access to public transportation with a bus stop around the corner and the underground a short walk away. The apartment was cozy and warm for our stay in October. Philippa was easy to communicate with before and during our stay and left us with plenty of instructions and tips. We would stay here and highly recommend!
15400,239862634,2018-03-03,16945938,Inna,"This is a perfect flat for exploring London. Cosy, clean, close to the tube station, with many places for a substantial breakfast or a quick pint. Philippa is a super friendly and hospitable host. Out stay was great (including no problems with hot water which is not a rare thing in London and the heating inspite of the Beast from the East). A highly recommended place!"
15400,245006157,2018-03-20,158725324,Shelley,This was a great 1 bedroom flat with all the amenities of home. A short 8-10 minute walk to two tube stations as well as around the corner from the flat was a Waitrose market which has everything you need at great prices. The flat is located in a quiet area of Chelsea and a great place to come home to after sightseeing all day. I would stay here again in this Chelsea flat.
15400,248028439,2018-03-30,16702019,Robert,"Perfect stay! Excellent location with the bus stop within 30 sec, and the tube within a 10 min walk. Central but still very quite. Great and safe area. Very easy check in and very well equipped lovely apartment, clean. Thank you Philippa!"
15400,434646586,2019-04-08,242469216,Lynn,"Location,  location, location!!!  Philippa is the greatest,  the communication is outstanding."
15400,438249851,2019-04-16,89780620,栗子Elly,Philippa的房子在住宅区内，环境很好，非常的安静，房间内设施很齐全(吹风机，洗衣机，烘干机，烤箱，微波炉以及洗碗机等等)，房东回复消息也很及时很好沟通。房子在一楼，面积不太大但是采光很好，客厅2面都有窗户非常的通透，步行到最近的地铁站大约需要10分钟，但是步行到最近的公交车站只需2~3分钟，到China town坐公交车不用换乘半个小时就能到。房间内可以做饭，不过附近没有中超或者亚超，最近的超市是Waitrose。
15400,441942910,2019-04-22,138449721,Sarah,"We had a lovely and comfortable stay in Philippa’s flat. The location is great, we found several excellent restaurants nearby (favorites were Murials and the Ivy), and it’s a short walk to the Kensington Station. The flat is cozy and bright, it got a little warm with the windows closed but once you open a couple there are lovely breezes that cool it right down. The shower is amazing with fantastic water pressure! Philippa is very responsive to questions and never took more than a day to respond even while she is on her own vacation.  We traveled on our 1st anniversary and she left us a welcome card and an anniversary card also which was so sweet. Highly recommend!"
15400,448626017,2019-05-05,100840491,Tim,"As advertised, it is a great place to stay. This was my third visit and I hope to return next year."
15400,506158053,2019-08-10,80916737,Rebecca,This was a perfect place to stay for 10 days while sightseeing in London. It was a little larger than I anticipated and was quite comfortable for two. The location is excellent — close to several bus lines and lots to do within walking distance. The construction was not very disruptive since it took place mostly when we were awake and out of the house. Overall an excellent experience. Just be sure to follow Philippa’s instructions rather than GPS in finding the address!
15400,518739648,2019-08-27,121806482,Маргарита,"Квартира очень уютная, небольшая, расположена в благополучном и красивом районе Челси. Состоит из небольшого коридора, спальни с кроватью шириной примерно 140-150 см. и объединённой гостиной с кухней, в обеих комнатах по два окна на разные стороны, они очень светлые. <br/>Автобусная остановка Chelsea Old Town Hall и большой супермаркет Waitrose, работающий с 7-30 до 22 часов, расположены в 5 минутах пешком. До станции метро прогулочным шагом минут 15. В 10 минутах пешком к центру на Кинг Роуд есть недорогие  места, чтобы перекусить - Pret A Manger и Itsu, да и вся улица представляет собой сплошные магазинчики. <br/>В квартире есть все, что может потребоваться во время проживания, включая посуду и кухонную утварь для приготовления различных блюд. Приятно, что есть капсульная кофемашина Нескафе Дольче Густо и тостер.<br/>Wi-fi есть, работает нормально, также есть Нетфликс со всевозможными фильмами, мультфильмами и передачами (на английском, разумеется). <br/>Хозяйка, Филиппа, отвечает на любые вопросы через связь на сайте очень любезно, оперативно и подробно. <br/>Непосредственно рядом с домом идёт реконструкция здания, работы начинаются примерно с 7-30 в будни, заканчиваются достаточно рано, в выходные не работают. Мы в это время встаём, нам шум от стройки не мешал, но для кого-то может быть важно."
15400,534972396,2019-09-23,173384412,Игорь,Great time in London!<br/> Thanks to the owner of a beautiful house
15400,619062614,2020-03-16,94988736,Michael & Julie,The location is excellent.  Shops and cafes  a block away. The flat is located in a quiet building on a quiet street.  There is construction going on next door but it did not bother us. It was very comfortable and a relaxing place to return at the end of a long day.  We would definitely stay again.
49970,160176,2010-12-29,160135,Christian,Great value room (shared bathroom but I never saw anyone else).<br/><br/>Boris could not possibly have been more helpful; he'd be reason enough to return.<br/><br/>Certainly recommended. 
49970,192563,2011-03-05,369665,Mihkel,"Boris was very helpful and forthcoming.<br/>The room was nice,clean and fully equipped, we enjoyed our stay."
49970,195499,2011-03-09,403879,Nina,"Boris is very, very helpful!  We would definitely recommend! The rooms where we stayed were very clean, cozy and complete with everything one would need. I would definitely reach out to Boris next time I'm in London.  Thanks, Boris!"
49970,202101,2011-03-18,378633,Brook,"The Aviva rooms are great, and I would recommend them for your stay in London. They are conveniently located in Zone 2 in a short walking distance to the Hammersmith tube station, and there are also several buses that stop right across the street. Also in a short walking distance from the house there is a shopping mall and shopping area as well as two traditional English pubs. It was very easy to take the Underground straight from Heathrow airport to the studio. Boris is very friendly and graciously greeted me, even when I arrived earlier than planned. The Aviva rooms are just like having your own hotel room, but without the hassle associated with low cost hotels. I originally planned to stay at a hotel in London but they were so expensive and the guest reviews were awful, so I turned to AirBNB, and I am glad I did. Aviva 7 is half the cost of comparable hotel rooms AND you get a kitchenette. If you are looking for a hotel room experience, this is the property for you. You have your own studio and can come and go as you please. I didn't see Boris during my stay, but I knew he was available on site should I ever need anything. I think you will have an enjoyable experience if you come with realistic expectations for the cost. Yes, the walls were thin, the bed was not particularly comfortable - but you would get these same conditions at a hotel room for TWICE the price. I would recommend, however, that if you like to read in bed, to bring a portable reading light as their is none in Aviva 7 (only light source is the window and overhead room light). Also if you like to sleep with two pillows, to bring a second with you (although you may be able to ask Boris for one as well). In conclusion, the Aviva studios are a bargain for their cost, and the location alone is worth it."
49970,204622,2011-03-21,374240,Dinah,It was a very great experience. Boris himself was as kind as a host could be! Very clean and cute appartment. I can really advise you to stay there!
49970,208832,2011-03-25,439490,Tony,"Fantastic,.Book with Boris with full confidence,Boris and his wife are a lovely warm friendly caring couple,that live on the property so are always available to advise ,take care of you and keep everything to the highest standard.The apartment was better than  the photos and recently refurbished<br/>Extremely well cleaned .Location is fantastic 4 minutes walk to the Hammersmith station which is a Major Train and Bus centre,3 minutes walk to really nice cafes,pubs,large shopping mall,all fast foods and main shopping street ,The Location is Quiet day and night so you will sleep like a log<br/>Communication was first class on all levels,Overall, I dont think you will find better value for money in London ! I certainly will be returning to Boris's Apartments at first instance   "
49970,216495,2011-04-04,229246,Gigi,"Small but extremely comfortable studio. All the furnitures are perfect for your stay. You have tv with satellite receiver, a kitchenette where to cook some meals after a long day and a large bed. All is very clean and in a very good price!"
49970,220057,2011-04-07,401183,Tim,Conveniently located. The tube is a 5 minute walk and plenty of restaurants in the area. Apartment was very clean and Boris was more than accommodating . I plan on recommending Boris to friends traveling through London. 
49970,224153,2011-04-12,378485,Amaia,"The studio was just as described! It has everything you are going to need during your stay, and the hosts are really friendly. <br/>The area is 20 minutes away from the center of London by underground, and the station is really close to the studio. There's also a shopping area nerby where you can get pretty much anything.<br/>We had a great experience and will definitely recommend it to friends. I'd come back without a doubt.<br/>Thank you!<br/>"
49970,229614,2011-04-18,356900,Stuart,"I stayed in Aviva 7. Boris does an amazing job keeping these units in a clean condition. On arrival, Boris was there to welcome me and explain anything I needed.<br/><br/>I can only comment on Aviva 7. Other units may be different. Be aware that this is basic accomodation. The rooms are small. This is not a fancy place by any means. But for a very reasonable price, you get a comfortable bed, kitchen appliances, a quiet room, and plenty a nearby shopping. London is about 30 minutes by tube. <br/><br/>I have stayed in places in London that were as small at mutiples of what I paid here.<br/><br/>IEven if you are not on a tight budget, this is a place to consider for a few days.<br/><br/>The 5 star rating is based on Boris's achivement of a room for a very reasonable rate. "
49970,246185,2011-05-01,378866,Casey,"Boris was a great host and the apartment and building were SO NICE. I would say the pictures don't do it justice. It felt more like a hotel (in a good way) than an apartment. The building was nice and updated, and the neighborhood was great. A very short walk to the Hammersmith ""tube"" station made it very convenient. We loved staying there and had a relaxing stay... even on the crowded Royal Wedding weekend. I would definitely stay there again. Thanks Boris!"
49970,248535,2011-05-02,516917,Anqi,Though i didn't get to stay there due to personal reason but the process of booking and enquiry with Boris was fantastic. He replied very promptly and give good alternatives when the room i wanted was not available.<br/><br/>*please do not see my rating as it is not very accurate because i didn't  get to stay there. But i wanted to post a review  on my good experience with Boris..
49970,274389,2011-05-22,375511,Larry,The apartment location was great as it was next to a train/bus terminal and was about half way between the airport and the heart of London. Boris met us on arrival and got us situated in the unit promptly. The apartment was just right for us and everything worked properly. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others. Larry McLeod Houston Texas. 
49970,320197,2011-06-18,463950,Melissa,"The studio was clean, compact and had everything I needed.  It is an easy walk from the tube station.  Boris was very helpful with all my questions. "
49970,350985,2011-07-04,348266,Laetitia,"We didn't stay in Aviva despite we booked 6 nights, because of broken pipes damaged the roof of the room we reserved, so officially it is not appropriate to leave the feedback.<br/>But I insist expressing our deep thanks to Boris and his wife here that, they were very helpful looking us a place to stay, very nice making sure everything was okay, while at the same time dealing with the all-in-a-sudden damage.<br/>From our couchsurfing experience(a night at their living room), we can at least tell you: the apartment is perfectly located with most things around, neighborhood is quiet and safe, and they are genuine people to trust."
49970,512631,2011-09-08,453934,Andreas,We really enjoyed our stay at Aviva Studio! It was clean and quit. Very close to the Hammersmith underground stop. Highly recommended if you are travelling on a budget.
49970,1061212,2012-03-30,1594113,Kate,"Excellent location, I stayed in a couple of different rooms.  first was room 9 which was a large 3 person room and second was room one which was a lovely room tucked away in the.  Its a clean, warm dry and safe place to stay and it located really well for the tube etc.<br/><br/>I found that noise travelled within the building and thats why i have marked it 4 stars rather than 5 - if i was able i would have marked 4.5 stars.  If i had stayed in the attic the whole time I would have scored it 5 stars as it was really peacful up there :)<br/><br/>I am usually in London for a few days do its great taht there is a hob and an oven as well as a microwave, little touches such as salt and pepper, a wine glass, a chopping board and a sharp knife in the room as well as a wee mint on my pillow all help to make your visit as comfortable as possible. I will definatley reccomend this venue to my colleagues"
49970,2775086,2012-11-01,327416,Kelly,"We were really impressed by the quality and professionalism of Boris and his room. He was great to communicate with, and the studio is lovely (the photos don't do it justice!). After traveling for a month, it was so nice to stay in such a clean and comfortable studio (it was our favorite place on our whole trip). The bed was awesome--my boyfriend loved the pillows, and the shower was the best of our trip (great water pressure, and plenty of hot water). The studio was really well located, very close to the tube, with access to several lines, so it made it very convenient to get around (also convenient to/from heathrow, which was a big plus for us). The street was nice and quiet, and we slept like babies! I would definitely stay here again, and I would highly recommend this place to anyone else looking for a place to stay. "
49970,2794499,2012-11-03,3314869,Priyadarshini,"i was at aviva 7 for only one night but boris and his wife were extremely sweet about everything. they let us check in early and we could also leave our luggage with them after check out since our flight was only at night. boris even helped us with our big luggage! while the apartment is a bit small if you're considering longer stays and are more than one person, aviva does have other options as well. number 7 was perfect for my requirements :) "
49970,4487460,2013-05-07,6233752,Gaille,"Thank you Boris for providing such welcoming, comfortable, and pleasant accommodation to a weary traveller!<br/><br/>I will certainly stay again!"
49970,5632596,2013-07-09,5010621,Brittni,"Lovely experience, felt like home :) kitchen facilties meant we didnt have to eat out every night, but great pubs and restaurants nearby if we felt like heading out for breaky/lunch/dinner :) Boris was a great host, let us check in a little early which was much appreciated and carried our bag up the stairs to our lovely room. Will stay again, loved Hammersmith, thanks again Boris and family :)"
49970,5690744,2013-07-12,801063,Clare,"We arrived at Aviva Studios after around 12 hours travelling, and found it very easy to reach via underground train from Heathrow, with the help of accurate directions from Boris.<br/>Our studio was neat, nicely decorated, fresh and spotless, and was extremely well-equipped for a short stay, including plenty of the essentials in the kitchen for making breakfast and light snacks. <br/>The area is quiet, leafy, well served by buses (we used to 27 to Paddington numerous times) as well as being a stone's throw from places to eat and shop (Tesco Express very handy at the tube station).<br/>We slept soundly and really enjoyed our little haven in London and we found our hosts to be extremely pleasant, welcoming and helpful. <br/>I have recommended this little gem to several of my friends, as it is very good value and we loved staying there. <br/>"
49970,7504882,2013-09-23,4805177,Maggie,"Great location, room was exactly as pictured. Was a bit small for a long stay though. We were only there for 2 nights. "
49970,13331992,2014-05-25,15732286,Liam,"Very good accommodation and excellent location, really happy with our stay and our dealings with Boris.<br/>Many thanks."
49970,14738766,2014-06-25,14927082,Sq,"I had a wonderful stay at the studio. Extremely value for the price I paid and what was provided exceeded my expectations. Room was small but what can I expect of a studio in the city of London... Everything was very clean and amenities nicely provided for which made the stay extremely cosy. Was touch tricky finding the place when I first arrived but it is really just less than 5mins walk from hammersmith tube station. There's tesco supermarket and other shops at the station itself, so really convenient. I would definitely stay here again when I go back to london! "
49970,16451379,2014-07-28,12870112,Catherine,Boris was really nice and welcoming. The apartment was as described and pictured. It was perfect for our one night stay. The area was also really nice with lots of shops and restaurants and a really nice park a short walk away.<br/><br/>We would definitely stay again if in the area. 
49970,18075875,2014-08-21,8642007,Shane,"We loved staying here, great area and very close to the metro (took about 20-30 mins to reach Picadilly Circus). It felt safe and it was close to lots of shops. The studio apartment was very clean and fresh, we were so thankful for the room service each day."
49970,18980005,2014-09-04,9908298,Sam,"Fantastic Apartment.  Well situated - 5 mins walk from tube station, and 10 min walk from Arena - so ideal for staying here for events at the arena.  Quiet area, we were not bothered by any noise either internally or externally - although we were at rear of property.  We were greeted most warmly and shown to our room, which was for 3 people (only 2 of us) - and it seemed a decent enough size, extremely clean, and enough facilities/equipment to cook and eat a meal (although we only stayed for one night - so didn't bother).  Bathroom good size, nice and clean and good shower.  Bed very comfortable, and very clean.  Nice modern décor.  A very good stay and would come back and also recommend."
49970,19352602,2014-09-10,20432684,Charlotte,"This was a great place to stay, really close to the station and the local amenities. Was very easy to get there and arrange to stay and Boris was really very helpful in advance and then as I checked in. Would definitely stay again. Room was very clean, well maintained and had everything you would need overnight.  "

49970,20600335,2014-10-02,17486933,Rommi,"A handy and very convenient location for going to see the Kate Bush concert at the Hammersmith Odeon. Overall, a well-kept suite which had everything I needed in it for one night. Might be a bit small for a longer stay, but then I also had three suitcases with me.. and another person might not. A comfy bed. Boris very helpful with carrying luggage upstairs as there is no lift. Good to have access to a small kitchenette to prepare food. "
49970,22796184,2014-11-15,16740317,Belén,"La semana pasada estuvimos tres dias en Londres para cumplir el sueño de ver un concierto en directo de Lykke Li, nuestra cantante favorita.  Elegimos los apartamentos Aviva por la cercania al teatro Eventim Apollo (apenas unos minutos andando) y realmente este alojamiento superó nuestras expectativas. <br/>La primera noche, nuestro apartamento no estaba listo todavía y nos pasaron a otro en el edificio de al lado.<br/> Simplemente increíble.  Un apartamento enorme, con dos cuartos de baño, amplio dormitorio y salón con zona de comedor y cocina incluida.  Todo limpio, (Website hidden by Airbnb) faltaba detalle, era lo más parecido a estar en casa.<br/>Las dos noches restantes estuvimos en otro apartamento un poco más pequeño pero igual de encantador.  Las camas cómodas, toallas limpias todos los dias, un pequeño kit de desayuno, ducha perfecta con agua caliente...  La calle es muy tranquila,  apenas escuchas ruido y a pocos minutos tienes toda la zona comercial.  Había una pequeña plaza con comidas de todas las partes del mundo,que nos encantó.<br/>En general el barrio, muy cosmopolita, alegre y tranquilo a la vez.  Tienes bares, tiendas y restaurantes a un paso.  También está muy cerca el metro y la estación de Hammersmith,  donde puedes coger trenes y buses a donde quieras. La gerencia del hospedaje extremadamente amable.  La chica que nos atendió un verdadero encanto.<br/>Sin duda, volveremos algún día a esta zona y nos volveremos a alojar aqui.<br/>Una experiencia única.  100% recomendable"
49970,23476415,2014-12-01,23932862,Andy,"Extremely welcoming and friendly host. Secure, quiet and comfortable room, well kept and exceptionally clean. 2 mins walk to the tube and shops so well placed. Great for a short stay over. "
49970,24543882,2014-12-30,16435725,Luca,"My gf and I spent Christmas in London, and had a lovely stay at the Aviva. The position is awesome, just minutes from Hammersmith station, which assures an easy and quick link with the main hot-spots in London. The studio is small but it is smartly furnished and equipped with everything is required for a short stay, including pots, plates and a hairdrayer. We found the room very tidy and clean, and a daily cleaning service was available during the whole stay. Boris was a kind and helpful host:  we were impressed by the number of positive reviews he has and, once we met him, we have to say that they are very well-deserved. Before the departure,  we contacted him  and  he answered within minutes, giving  promptly all the informations we  were looking for. In conclusion, if you are looking for a smart accomodation in London, the Aviva is definitely the right choice. Absolutely recommended."
49970,26142851,2015-02-04,6831570,Yoni,The room is cozy. It's exactly like the pictures.<br/>Boris was very friendly and helpful.
49970,27807704,2015-03-12,21359375,Bridget,Stayed for a night before flying out of Heathrow. Great location - easy tube access to the city and to the airport. Boris was there to welcome us and helped us with our bags. The room was very clean and had everything we needed. Bed was a tad on the uncomfortable side but still got a good nights sleep. 
49970,34871715,2015-06-13,3833151,Karissa,Boris was very responsive to e-mails prior to our arrival. His studio was lovely and very easy to find (about 2-3 minutes walk from the Hammersmith Underground station). Boris even kept our luggage for us as we explored the city the next day and we picked it up on our way to the airport. Loved his place and his service!
49970,36694590,2015-06-30,28587071,Matt,"Loved it - just as it looks. Cosy, with everything you need, and a lovely location that's a short tube journey to  all the sites. "
49970,44627488,2015-08-28,23355538,Kevin,We arrived earlier than our estimated arrival time and our room was already prepared. Very accomodating host who helped with luggage and laundry service.<br/>5 minutes walk to tube and buses with easy access to central London and shops and supermarket. <br/>Room was quiet had comfortable bed with kitchen facilities and was excellent for our needs.<br/>Would highly recommend.
49970,47468444,2015-09-19,36080297,Kimberly,"We had a great stay in Hammersmith. We couldn't have found a better host or a better location. The apartment was clean, private, and cosy.  Dorsica made our first Airbnb experience perfect. "

49970,64677647,2016-03-06,56636364,Joseph,Listing description of the accommodation and area were accurate. Flat was only a 3 minute walk from nearest underground line. 
49970,67811997,2016-03-31,38167225,Jonathan,Boris was a very good host he helped my friends on their check in and check out. He was waiting for us outside in the middle of the rain for our coming.
49970,84785079,2016-07-09,12762193,Jenny,"Sadly, there was an accidental double booking. But when I arrived they had arranged for me to stay at the B&B next door at no additional cost to me, which was lovely. Thanks for the quick fix! "
49970,87101365,2016-07-18,53758171,Melinda,"Although we did not have the pleasure of meeting Boris, his wife is an extraordinary woman,gracious in every way. She was helpful with Directions, current events,and any need we had which more than made up for the basic accommodations. It is brilliantly located to the underground,and great restaurants. We were happy to stay there."
49970,95765674,2016-08-20,8328024,Rosa,"Hemos estado 11 días en este apartamento. Es pequeño pero con todo lo necesario para poder preparar desayunos o una cena improvisada. Está todo muy limpio, cambian las toallas cada día y también limpian el apartamento. La cama es muy cómoda. Está en una zona que aunque no es el centro está perfectamente comunicada con cuatro líneas de metro, que te llevan a cualquier lugar en 15-20 minutos. El metro está a cuatro minutos andando del alojamiento, es una zona muy tranquila y en la calle de abajo hay restaurantes, supermercados, sitios de comida rápida y en el mismo metro un supermercado Tesco que abre hasta medianoche. Boris fue muy amable, contestó siempre rápidamente a mis preguntas y nos ayudó a subir y bajar las maletas, nosotros estabamos en un segundo piso. Recomendaría este apartamento y yo misma si vuelvo a Londres repetiría aquí mi estancia."
49970,112488511,2016-11-06,84729497,Alexis,"¡Todo fue genial! El habitación era limpia y super guay. La localización del Airbnb es muy cerca al centro de Hammersmith. Fuimos a un conciento en el Eventim Apollo, y solo era un camino de minutos."
49970,115174208,2016-11-22,92586061,Sam,"Cozy, little apartment in the heart of Hammersmith with wonderful access to public transport, this was a good place to stay but I would highly recommend more than 1 night, as we didn't get to experience as much as we would have liked. Bathroom and apartment was a little small, but good use of space, I would stay again. "
49970,122274043,2016-12-22,21985585,Rafal,"Location was awesome. 30 min away from the center of London from Hammersmith. Lots of cafes, restaurants, banks, grocery stores nearby. I parked right in front of the place. After 18:30, parking is free until 8:30 in the morning the next day. Room was a bit smaller than I thought but it was the perfect size for a one day stay. The room had all the necessities, even a kitchen sink, fridge, and stove. Lovely place. Would stay again!"
49970,124262980,2017-01-01,44144529,Elodie,Boris was available whenever we needed and welcomed us properly. The place is exactly in line with the photos we can see on website and has all the necessary equipment.<br/>The appartment is next to the underground (3 minutes walking) which is very convenient.<br/><br/>We recommend Boris' flat and we will come back for sure. Thank you Boris.
49970,142245720,2017-04-07,5142023,Alan,"This place was so convenient and perfect to stay in for a London trip. Would 100% recommend for both business and pleasure, it's close to everything you need in Hammersmith which also has great tube connections to everywhere in the city and also Heathrow airport. The rooms are clean and exactly as seen in the photos. We will be staying again!"
49970,147966887,2017-04-29,65071478,Ashley,Great little spot to crash in Hammersmith! We stayed here for a quick overnight to London and the location was great - close to public transportation and tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Room was comfortable and quiet; overall a great stay!
49970,156581747,2017-05-31,3610047,Kathy,"This is a great place for a quick overnight stay! Located centrally to all of Hammersmith, close to tube so it's a short hop anywhere in the city. Place was immaculately clean, great use of space and really nice water pressure. "
49970,157333157,2017-06-03,43420694,Carolyn,"accomodating and let us drop off luggage before check in time, helped us book a cab, helpful with directions. conveniently located only 5 mins walk from hammersmith, but you really should ask for specific directions to avoid taking the long route around the block. overall, good stay here for the location. "
49970,163083976,2017-06-23,67566724,Vikki,"The studio was perfectly located near bars, restaurants, the Lyric theatre and the Apollo. However it was still really quiet, on a more residential road just minutes walk away from everything. The studio was perfectly clean, with the most comfortable pillows I have ever slept on! It has everything you need, with a hob and microwave as well as a fridge. It even had an air conditioning unit which was really welcomed as it was a super hot evening. Tea and coffee provided as well as linen and towels. The shower was pretty good, it took a while to get warm but then it was lovely, and very roomy which was unexpected for a small studio. The bed also was a big double and very comfortable. I highly recommend this studio and I will definitely stay again! "
49970,164625691,2017-06-28,13088778,Sam,"Just as described. Feels like a small hotel room with a minimal kitchen. Great for 1-2 people who don't plan on entertaining/spending too much time at the space (only due to room size). Very clean, in a nice neighborhood, and close to public transit."
49970,165475100,2017-07-01,14646881,Keri,"The host was wonderful. Everything about our stay was wonderful. The room was very clean and well organized. We had chocolates on our pillows when we arrived. Boris helped us bring the luggage upstairs and downstairs when we checked in and out. Our room was on the 3rd floor so that was very helpful after a long tiring flight. The owners of the building lives below so they are always available.  Boris recommended some great restaurants while we were there. The neighborhood is very safe and has plenty of great food and stores within 5-10 minute walking distance. The Hammersmith train station is about a 5 minute walk. All in all, it was a wonderful stay. "
49970,168879764,2017-07-10,131709167,Rosie,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Aviva studios for our last night in England. The location was very easy to find, especially from Hammersmith station. It was clearly marked with post on the building for 'Aviva'. We stayed in a small studio room with a little kitchen, which we did not use. However, it was stocked with plenty of kitchen utensils, which we used to eat our Indian Takeout. The most 'warm' welcome for us, was finally indulging in the joys of air conditioning, which was much needed after the sweltering weather (which we can't complain about, of course). The location was perfect for us because we were flying out from Heathrow, which was a half an hour train ride directly from Hammersmith. <br/><br/>We ordered food from Indian Express, which delivered to the building...and if you love Indian food, I strongly recommend it! All of the grocery stores were closed because it was a Sunday night, so we walked about 5 minutes to a little shop, the Tipsy Toad, where we were greeted by a very nice woman. We got some beer (which is essential for Indian) and went on out merry way."
49970,171357124,2017-07-17,17896050,Hannah,"We stayed here one night as we flew in from stansted and out from heathrow the next morning. The location was great for catching public transit so we could get into the city, and also for getting to the airport the next morning. We also walked to a nearby restaurant and there were plenty of options. The room was clean, well-kept and just what we needed. If we come back to London, we would definitely stay here again."
49970,189058040,2017-08-31,8131668,Jane,We found everything as written in descriltion.  It was good.
49970,192374462,2017-09-10,149039686,Michelle,Exactly how Boris describes. Perfect links to central London and only a 3 minute walk to the tube/bus station. Highly recommended.

49970,239139719,2018-02-28,86499230,Emma,"L'alloggio si trova in una zona davvero comoda, a 2 minuti dalla stazione della metro dalla quale passano le 4 linee principali! Anche il quartiere in sé é piacevole e c'é tutto il necessario. Boris, signora che ci ha accolti e signora dei servizi molto cortesi, discreti e piacevoli. La stanza era piccolina ma okay per il prezzo e pulita in tutto, letto spazioso, bagno molto piccolo con lavandino inutile (abbiamo usato quello della cucina, peró) mentre la doccia era buona. La finestra della camera non stava aperta e il piumone sul letto scaldava eccessivamente, ma nel complesso é stato un soggiorno piacevole. Nota positiva, le prese universali, anche usb."
49970,270749648,2018-05-30,56962628,Siusiu,Hammersmith車站去所有景點都很方便。<br/>距離民宿大約步行5-10分鐘，很近。屋主都很親切友善。基本上附近餐廳，supermarket，小食店應有盡有。整體感覺良好！溫馨提示:要走樓梯的，但絕對沒有影響住宿體驗。十分推薦
49970,360104558,2018-12-19,149230065,Cristobal,If you are a couple I recommend Boris's apartment since my girlfriend and I were very comfortable.
49970,360610951,2018-12-21,15989219,Gabriela,Really convenient and great value for what we needed. Boris was a great host.
49970,361772567,2018-12-24,93702948,Nissa,"Bori's place was really wonderful. The location was just superb, with just walking distance to restaurants and shopping area. Apartment that we booked was very comfortable for two people. Off street parking was a convenience indeed. A great place in Hammersmith to live in ! Will be booking next time too when we visit."
49970,362400380,2018-12-26,227490241,Kostas,"Nice and clean room, very close to the Underground station of Hammersmith (Picadilly line-line that heads to Heathrow terminals). Boris respond quickly to our questions as we visited London at a very difficult day with no means of transport (25th of Dec)!!! We will definitely choose him for our next visit to London!"
49970,364817703,2018-12-31,213158421,Sarah,"Good value for money, close to all of the amenities!"
49970,366233617,2019-01-02,34691991,Alanna,Great place to stay before our Heathrow flight. The tube is a short walk away and it takes about 30 minutes to get to the airport. Recommend!
49970,369331027,2019-01-10,169129135,Mel,"Check in was super easy and quick. The room was clean and modern, having all essentials in for a few nights stay, but could easily serve as a base for a longer term. Good access to central London via the tube and plenty of shops and restaurants in Hammersmith (on the doorstep!) too!"
49970,402385623,2019-01-18,3560443,Amy,"Sparkling clean, just a stone's throw from Hammersmith station. Comfortable bed, secure location, and check-in/out was a breeze. Would highly recommend and will definitely stay again in the future. Thank you, Boris!"
49970,403172888,2019-01-20,44681611,Lucilla,This place was absolutly perfect for our journey in London: very clean and close to the underground to reach the center of London in a few. Very recommended!
49970,404501272,2019-01-24,230752321,María Esther,Perfecto para dos personas .<br/>Super calentito ...<br/>Acogedor .  Comunicación con el transporte público super cerquita . <br/>Vamos ... Tal y como lo venden ..
49970,407513516,2019-02-02,50714161,Laura,Great zone with comfortable apartments. Very recommended!
49970,408753098,2019-02-05,21868377,Meghan,"This apartment is very tiny as the description says, but it was perfect for our one night stay. We weren’t really sure about the location but it was actually fantastic! The apt is about a block from Hammersmith station so we took the tube there from the airport. We ate at a pub called The Swan (so good!) and had breakfast around the corner at a small Crepe place. Lots of places to eat/drink within a couple blocks."
49970,409602639,2019-02-08,75589244,Daniel,"I could definitely recommend this Studio for people who want to discover London. It is located in Hammersmith near the underground station, which is just a 5 minute walk from the Studio. Communication with Boris was super, he always answered after a few minutes. Check-In was also easy, because there is a small reception on the ground floor of the building. The studio itself was very clean, everything matched with the Airbnb description."
49970,412386509,2019-02-15,32337269,Susan,The studio is in a great location just a few minutes' walk from both the Hammersmith stations so there is lots of choice of tubes and buses.  We dealt mainly with Boris' wife who was lovely - really friendly and helpful. The studio is small but was fine for 5 nights although larger men may find the shower and wash basin a little on the small side.  It had everything we needed and was spotlessly clean and very tastefully decorated. The studio is in a house with several studios/apartments in it (which was not clear to me at the time of booking) so you do hear other guests moving around as in any hotel. This particular studio looks out on to Glenthorne Road which is a fairly busy one-way street and although the glazing in the windows is very good one does hear a bit of road noise and also the trains that run on the other side of the building site opposite where work starts relatively early. Although I am a very light sleeper it was OK with the windows closed and earplugs. Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again.
49970,528558778,2019-09-13,189413583,Chrystophe-Pierre,"Excellente localisation (4 lignes de métro),  espace limité pour cuisiner. Équipé correctement pour cuisiner. Très propre et fiable au photo. Je le recommande."

49970,539885899,2019-10-02,230987539,Richard,"-great location on quiet street a 5 minute walk from tube/bus. <br/>-shops, restaurants, pubs nearby<br/>-good security, felt very safe<br/>-room very clean and serviced daily. Small but every space used well.<br/>-good wi fi.<br/>-will do laundry for a reasonable fee.<br/>-only negative was bathroom light on a motion sensor. Bothersome if you needed bathroom in the night, or would just come on randomly if you moved wrong!<br/><br/>Would stay here again!"
49970,542355772,2019-10-06,200185135,Alexandra,"Wir sind total begeistert. Alles ist super organisiert und professionell abgelaufen, das Apartment ist bestens ausgestattet und sehr geschmackvoll gestaltet. Z.B. haben wir sogar Adapter für das englische Stromnetz erhalten. Es war super sauber. Die Lage ist fantastisch. Alles (U-Bahn, Bus, Supermärkte, Shops, Restaurants und Pubs) in nur wenigen Minuten fußläufig zu erreichen. Boris ist ein hilfsbereiter und angenehmer Gastgeber. Wir haben uns rundum sehr wohlgefühlt und würden es jederzeit wieder buchen. Nur zu empfehlen!"
49970,622456104,2020-04-15,40039615,Ifeanyi,Wonderful host.
49970,623423483,2020-04-30,63472624,Tulio,"Boris and his wife were incredible. They were very accommodating and very quick to respond with any questions. They are also flexible with check-in and check-out time, which was extremely helpful. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities for a few night stay.<br/><br/>The neighborhood outside the apartment had a lot of life within walking distances. However, it was very quiet when you were in the loft. The apartment was walking distance to some tourist attractions, and it was close to the bus station and tube station to get you to the ones further away. This is definitely the perfect place to stay in Hammersmith."
49970,753276246,2021-04-30,50008234,Michael,The best hosts I've ever had on AirBnB! Very generous and accomodating with great services.

The location is stunning, 5 mins from the shops, restaurants and both tube and bus station. I should really hope to come back. I would recommend this hospitable and refreshing stay to anyone."

49970,412091993636856457,2021-07-22,78455415,Brian,"Contruction work 6 days a week, 10 hours a day. <br/><br/>Hottest week of the decade and if I had not followed up with a phone after my email 14 hours later,  I still be waiting for the air conditioner remote. <br/><br/>1 clean towel in 3 weeks, I went out to buy my own, same for the bed sheets for 19 days straight. <br/><br/>Great location, however huge disappointment, host was awake and told me he didn’t know about the record high weather in London. <br/><br/>He couldn’t read his emails, he informed me, however I’m sure he must have Airbnb APP ? ‍♀️<br/><br/>Worst stay ever!"
49970,456287285895794101,2021-09-21,21054375,Frances,"I stayed in a large room, with en-suite and kitchen area. Very comfortable and a good location for the tube, the Hammersmith Apollo and the Lyric theatre. <br/>I have problems with my knees and hips and was on a higher floor, so if stairs are a problem ask for a lower floor when you book.<br/>I’m happy to recommend this and would stay again."

93263,1663599,2012-07-09,1599711,Milan,The accommodation is OK. William is very helpful. The flat is 15 minutes walk from the centre and 30 minutes from tennis.
93263,150072923,2017-05-07,9451927,Tim,Super convenient to the south Wimbledon tube station. William waited for me when I was delayed picking up the keys. He also allowed me to check in early since my flight got in at 10am. I would book there again.

He communicated well throughout the entire process. He even came to our rescue and picked us up by car after we got lost and could not find his place when we first arrived. The apartment met our needs and I would recommend it.
93263,210114901,2017-11-07,13656144,Christiane,The host canceled this reservation 44 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

93263,286469902,2018-07-06,36573697,Gerayne,Not in a convenient location for attending the Championships Wimbledon. I paid for seven nights and left after one due to the location and condition of the apartment.

93263,305565174,2018-08-11,52454993,Antónia,This is a great place to stay in. Very close to the metro station and other facilities.  But there is some noise because of the traffic and because of the car station in front.
93263,316351887,2018-08-31,204966989,Hareen,Good location since the South Wimbledon tube station is just a very short walk away.  Local Sainsbury and Tesco branches help to grab the day to day groceries.

The Wimbledon high street is a mere 10-15 minutes walk. The secure parking on the site is a big help if one is keeping a car otherwise South Wimbledon tube station on the Northern line is just 2-3 minutes walk from the apartment. A great value for money. William has taken great care to provide all the details and check in and check out was absolutely hassle free.

But being in south Wimbledon it was a bit of a trek into central London. Overall we had a lovely stay! Thanks so much for all your help William! :)"

93263,560964235,2019-11-08,26543685,Jess,"Stayed here for a week whilst visiting family nearby. Whilst South Wimbledon itself is very quiet, the flat is very close to the tube and walking distance to Wimbledon. William’s place was spacious enough for 2 of us and was very comfortable. I would not hesitate to stay here again."

389125,4128661,2013-04-12,2068650,Mary-Anne,Fantastic hosts who made us feel at home in their own space. Close to the tube and handy for all of London. The room and internet woprked well and having our own ensuite helped us relax in this foreign space. Very comfortable big bed. The hosts were terrific and helped us sort out some IT problems when needed. Thank you for a great holiday in London.
389125,4581520,2013-05-13,6148730,Greg,"Excellent room just like a 4 star hotel room.  Shower was nice and bed was comfortable.  The neighborhood is very quiet and just a couple of blocks to the Bakerloo line which is very convenient to all the SoHo stations like Oxford Circus.  David is a great host, leaves you to come and go as you wish any time.  This was my first stay with Airbnb but it will be the first web site I check for future travels."

389125,5354516,2013-06-25,6936490,Stephanie,"As good as it gets! <br/><br/>Absolutely clean and spacious room with lovely ensuite - who would want to stay in a hotel? It was a few minutes walk to the nearest tube station, from which you were in the centre of London in no time at all. The area is nice and quiet, so perfect to relax after a hectic day of sight-seeing.<br/><br/>Thank you again for making our first airbnb-experience such a great one, and we would stay again any time when we're back in London!"

389125,5921435,2013-07-22,7285321,Evelyn,"When looking for a place to stay for a couple of nights in London, I was referred to David by a friend of mine who has stayed with him before. When arriving at David's, he and his partner have welcomed me with warmth and hospitality. The room is clean, quiet, comfortable and includes wi-fi. I can recommend this place to everybody. "
389125,6012317,2013-07-26,7079449,Kezia,"We really enjoyed our stay at David's place. We particularly love its spacious bed room, neat and clean private bathroom. Although we only met David when we arrived and didnt have a chance to see him when we left, but when we met David was very warm, friendly and welcome.  We also enjoyed his travelling experience story to our country. Very recommended. "
389125,6534787,2013-08-16,7207356,Hannya,"David and his partner were wonderful hosts and made my move to London easy and comfortable. The room is very well appointed with a private bathroom, wifi, and large bed. The room offers privacy, but access to the common areas including kitchen. I really enjoyed my stay!"
389125,7392604,2013-09-18,7098831,Nari,"Two of us stayed here for a week and what a great week it was! The room and ensuite bathroom is spotless, fairly big with enough space to leave suitcases open etc. Location is great- close to the tube as well as buses and we rarely spent more than 20mins in travel time. David was a very gracious host and extremely accommodating from the moment we arrive on the doorstep to the evening I went to collect my luggage well after check out time on the last day. <br/>Highly recommended, I would definitely stay here again!"
389125,7620565,2013-09-27,4582478,Lyn,"David was very helpful even before we arrived by answering my email questions quickly and helping us to arrange for a car service to get us to and from Heathrow. David's home is modern and spacious. The room and ensuite bath that we stayed in were a very good size and very clean. We bought food to keep in the kitchen for breakfast and enjoyed not having to be out for every meal. David also let us use his washer, which we appreciated. He gave us great recommendations for restaurants for dinner. We appreciated being near the tube and being able to get anywhere in 15-20 mins. There were restaurants and shops close by. It was nice to be in a real neighborhood and quiet enough to be able to sleep! David was a wonderful and gracious host and we would not hesitate to stay here again the next time we are in London."
389125,7793386,2013-10-03,8361760,Natalie,"Mum and I stayed here when we first arrived in London for 4 nights. When we returned from France and stayed with David again, it was like coming home. David is a very warm host making sure we feel like being at home at all times. His housemate, Ken, is also very  sweet, giving us a good house orientation, travel tips when we arrived. Ken even wanted to cook us dinner before we leave for the airport. Room is nice, clean, warm (it's getting cold in London in Oct now), spacious for two people and a nice bathroom.  There are even travel guides available in the room for guests to use for reference. Buses to Paddington, Victoria and Oxford Circle are just located nearby. It's a safe and quiet place to stay and we highly recommend this place to anyone who is considering to visit London looking for a place to stay. "
389125,7953666,2013-10-09,7624476,John,David and his partner were excellent hosts. The room was private and kitchen available for personal use.

389125,8260202,2013-10-22,876988,Theresa,We really enjoyed our stay at David’s. It was a great location for staying in London in a nice quiet neighbourhood that is still close to an underground station and bus routes so you can get anywhere you would like to visit. There are also shops and restaurants within a short walk. <br/>The room with ensuite was very clean and spacious. The bed was comfortable too. It was also really nice that they had lots of travel books and brochures about London available in the room.<br/>David and friends were very friendly and helpful with suggesting restaurants and transportation tips. Since we were out sightseeing during the day we didn't see them a lot but when we did they was always very welcoming. The relaxed nature made us feel at home. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to my friends when visiting London.
389125,8417270,2013-10-29,9346847,R-Elena,"David was very welcoming on arrival. He showed me around and then we sat down for a nice chat over some tea. I didn't see my hosts much during my stay but the room was immaculate and bed very comfortable. There were no problems whatsoever and David was very lovely to deal with, allowing me to feel at home. I had problems getting back on day of check out so he kindly allowed me to stay a few hours longer till the trains started running again.<br/><br/>Overall all positive and will definitely be returning again!<br/>"

389125,9154985,2013-12-09,10436013,Cecilia,"Pleasant, clean and warm room in a nice area, not far from central London (zone 2).

389125,9880690,2014-01-16,618283,Melissa,"David's place is lovely. Large room, comfortable bed, clean bathroom.  Honestly, everything you could want in a short-term space.  I especially loved the privacy of the room; I'm a bit of an introvert and appreciated that a lot."
389125,11590799,2014-04-08,7346859,Rachel,"My 1 week stay was perfect. From the beginning, David was accommodating despite me constantly changing my time of check-in due to prior work commitments. The room was spacious (there were many interesting books on London to read) and the toilet was clean. David and his partner were friendly without being intrusive and left me, the typical reticent asian girl to my own devices, haha. The neighbourhood is safe, 5 mins away from a Starbucks and I felt perfectly safe coming home at night, walking back from the tube at 11 - 12pm. The Bakerloo line where Maida Vale is on has direct trains to Paddington, Oxford Circus and Piccadilly, so it's all convenient. Or, take bus 98 from Oxford Street back if you get too tired walking all of London. Will definitely stay with them again the next time I am hopefully back in London!"
389125,11808223,2014-04-15,13045981,Collie,"Our time in David's home was very pleasant.  The accommodations were great and David was an easy host.  He was there and available when we needed him and we had fun conversations with him as well.  I'd always wanted to see inside one of the tall narrow townhomes and to stay in one was a treat!  The location was quiet, near the tube station, and within walking distance of lots of restaurants and shops. Our stay with David was successful and I can recommend it with pleasure.  "

Such a quiet place, so safe, (even when you came back late).<br/>David and friends were very friendly and helpful. Since I was working out during the day I didn't see them a lot but when we did, they were always very welcoming.

Our welcoming host contributed to make this trip a wonderful experience. We enjoyed the privacy of a perfectly clean and very comfortable room in which we could relax after a long day of walking and visiting. <br/>The house is located in a quiet neighbourhood, near a subway station. On the way to this station, the restaurant ""The Elgin"" serves excellent english breakfasts.<br/>We would not hesitate to stay here again the next time we are in London.<br/><br/>"

Pirtroppo non ho avuto modo di vedere David per via del Lavoro ma per quel poco che ci siamo visti ha dimostrato di essere un ottimo host!<br/>La zona è perfetta: molto tranquilla di notte ma vicina a pub, ristoranti ecc. La fermata dell'underground dista circa 4 minuti a piedi e in 15 minuti si è a Oxford Circus..perfetto!!"

The room was advertised as is and was felt like a nice room at a nice home in an established London neighborhood in Maide Vale. They were also very kind to offer to help if I needed any tips - to which they recommended me an amazing Thai restaurant (Spicy Basil) only a 7ish minute bus ride away... it was the most amazing and cheap Thai food I've ever had outside of Asia in a very unpretentious setting.<br/><br/>I had a good experience staying with them and I hope future guests will treat them well so that they will continue to host!"

Unfortunately the wifi didn't work, but I trust Gavin when he says that this was a unique incident and that the wifi normally works perfectly. The view from this apartment is absolutely gorgeous and it's only (approximately) a 20 minute train ride into the center of the city. Thanks again for everything Gavin!"

It was a surprise that my wife and I every left.<br/><br/>It's in possible the most beautiful part of London, on a gorgeous street and the place itself is adorable.<br/><br/>The hosts were amazing leaving us fresh fruit and fresh milk.

Even more cozy and inviting then the pictures show. We had a late check in due to delays with our travel and Geoff and Marianne were flexible with this which we appreciated. We were welcomed by Marianne who took time to explain how everything worked and had even brought us some fruit, coffee and breakfast for our stay. The apartment is lovely, special treats were the fab stand alone bath and of course Hampstead Heath which became our back garden for a week! I have recommended this apartment to my family and would do so to anyone looking for a home from home +more during their stay in London!  <br/>"

604687,6103818,2013-07-30,6361874,Louise,"Our family of 4 (2 adults & 2 children) stayed in this flat for 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The flat was spacious (2 very large bedrooms), comfortable and cool (during our travel period London was experiencing a very hot spell).  We were only a few minutes walk from Paddington Tube Station and after a full day of sight-seeing, found the space very relaxing for our group.  The flat is furnished beautifully, has high quality appliances & all the kitchenware and accessories we could possibly need (including a coffee machine & dishwasher) for our stay.  The flat was impeccably clean and it was evident that there has been a lot of attention to detail with respect to the host endeavoring to meet the needs of prospective guests.  The master bedroom has the most comfortable king size bed I have ever slept in!  The host Joel was very prompt with communication via email during the booking process and flexible with our arrival and departure time.  This is the first time my family have booked accomodation via a service like this, I found the entire process very professional and our experience was a positive one.  I would highly recommend this property to others looking to stay in the Paddington area, its proximity to the regular London tourist attractions was fantastic and we were able to walk to Lord's Cricket Ground (10 minutes walk).  On route to the Paddington Tube were plenty of cafes, restaurants and a supermarket, all within a 5 minute walk.  Thank-you Joel & it was lovely meeting you too (Website hidden by Airbnb) "
604687,7647614,2013-09-28,5023639,Shira,"We are a family of two parents and two children and the space fitted us greatly.The apartment was really comfortable and decorated very nicely - clean and  bright. All kitchen gadgets, electrical appliances and wi-fi were working as expected.  The location was great - close to Paddington station but still very quiet. In short - this is a really recommended apartment.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"
604687,8124107,2013-10-16,8244924,Farizul,"Joel is serious about his apartment rental business and it shows in the quality stuffs that he have in the apartment.<br/>Quality beds, good TVs, ovens, dishwasher and even a nice espresso maker.<br/>I like the location too. Walking distance from the Paddington Station where you can take the Heathrow Express straight from the airport.<br/>And I like to walk, so walking everyday to Oxford Street is also very doable.<br/>WiFi however was a little problematic. Joel lives upstairs and so is the router. So, depending on your device, there are some pockets of areas where the reception is bad. In a perfect world, the router should be in the apartment or at least a wifi extender.<br/>But all in all, the apartment was great."

We felt at home right away and we slept incredibly well every night thanks to the generous bed sizes, clean linen and quiet surrounds. The light rumble of the underground trains every now and then subsided during the later part of the night as services stopped until morning. This didn’t bother us though.

604687,582591269,2019-12-27,272413402,Heather,"Fantastic location. Right near 2 tube stations,  restaurants and bars. Flat was really warm and felt like home. More space than we expected. Really comfortable. Kitchen well stocked. Joel was really helpful  and a great host. Would stay every visit to London."
714723,2815959,2012-11-05,3880703,Anne,"The flat in East London was a great experience, as we really felt like local Londoners.  Upon arrival that evening, we were greeted by Carolyn's brother-in-law, who actually walked down to where we were and met us on the main road!  It may have been a bit tricky to locate the flat at night, otherwise. The welcome letter had specific tips, restaurant and activity recommendations that we followed and it really enhanced our visit. The flat is lovely.  Beds were very comfortable, and had all the amenities we needed.  When we requested an extra blanket, we had a quick response of where we could find the blanket. Her sister was so helpful answering questions and it was comforting to know that she was in close proximity  in case we had any needs. A great experience!"
714723,2858113,2012-11-11,1365382,Andrew,"Wonderful garden apartment, everything you need to stay in London, with great tube connectivity ( 3 min walk to nearest station). Carolyn and Cheryl were wonderful hosts and made our time in London even more pleasant and convenient. If you're looking for cheap airport transfer to and from the apartment, it's about 40-45 gbp each direction, which is insanely cheap, just let them know in advance. The place is in very good condition and spending the evenings there was much more comfortable than hotel rooms. "
714723,2941740,2012-11-22,3508922,Ann,"Really beautiful two bedroom flat, just as in the photos.  There is also a small private garden which would be lovely to sit out in good weather.  Cheryl and Nigel provided access and key collection.  There was also a welcome pack and useful list with suggestions of places to go, eat and how to work the electrical items.  Very helpful and nearby if there were to be any problems.  The location was handy for Tower Bridge and Aldgate East tube stations.  I highly recommend this accommodation and will recommend it to friends."
714723,2970301,2012-11-26,1954919,Marika & Matthias,"Me and my three friends stayed in Carolyn´s apartment for three nights and we enjoyed our stay there a lot. The apartment is very well located and nicely decorated, the garden is very cute, we loved the kitchen and the sofa (the same sofa I have at home!!). It was very cosy, clean and simply perfect for us. The smaller bed could have been a little more comfortable for two adults , but it was still all right for us. Carolyn was very kind to help us planning our trip to London in advance and she really made this very special! Her sister Cheryl was also very helpful and an absolute sweetheart. We had a very nice time in the apartment and I would always recommend it to my friends!"
714723,3025195,2012-12-04,3997101,Sophie,"<br/>The Carolyn's flat is as attractive than in the pictures ! I liked a lot the decoration, enough neutral to fell at home, but much warmer than an hotel ! Cheryl, her sister, was present from our arrival and very welcoming, she show us and explain everything : heating, the ready breakfast for the next day (GREAT not need to go shopping this evening!), bunches of keys, WiFi password, TV, electric blankets, towels, the small garden... we felt immediately at home!<br/><br/>Cheryl insisted and asked to call her if we have any problem. We tried to manage by ourselves, but it was pleasant to have somebody close in case. Moreover, Cheryl helped us to find cab number available and cheap …<br/>We didn't know the area very well and in 3 days it's been difficult to get used with buses and tube, but with the bus line 15 we were easily able to join the center of London in about 20 minutes. Even if the streets of this district are not very animated, we felt safe in the evening. In brief, my friends and I loved to stay longer in this flat.<br/><br/>When we left, Nigel came to find us to get back keys, he trusted us, it was nice. I will recommend this apartment to others friends, and without any doubt, i 'll check if it's available , next time i need to find accommodation in London..."
714723,3104734,2012-12-17,3972881,Jenni,"Absolutely wonderful Airbnb experience! Carolyn was so helpful and quick to respond to my questions, it couldn't have been easier to arrange my stay. Her sister Cheryl was there to meet me on arrival and couldn't have been nicer - she's a very bubbly character who will make you feel at home instantly! It was great to know that she was on hand by phone for anything. The flat itself was PERFECT - super trendy, comfortable, homely, with everything you could need! It just felt like a treat to stay there for a week :-) So many wonderful details to enjoy - Carolyn and Danny have a great eye for design! Plus the location is great, very safe and central, just round the corner from Shadwell station and easy to get anywhere in the city. Waitrose is nearby too for cosy evenings in dining at home. Great value for money and I hope to stay there again next time I visit London! Thanks Carolyn and Cheryl for making my stay special!"
714723,3250339,2013-01-03,2102218,Stephanie,"Carolyn is a great host! she was most efficient in our communication before the trip, she offered to meet me with the keys in NYC , then arranged for her lovely sister cheryl to meet us at the house upon arrival. The apartment is just as shown in the photos. The space is really cute with contemporary furnishings which we enjoyed, and comfortable for us three ladies! The nearest tube station is shadwell on the overground line-was operating with limited service that week, which was a bit of an inconvenience, however there are many buses nearby and taxi's are easy to get as well. Carolyn gave us a very informative welcome packet that pretty much eliminated any need for us to contact her, as it was extrememly helpful and answered all of our questions. The front door was a bit challenging at first, but once we got the hang of it, getting in and out of the house was a breeze! over all we had a great experience at the apartment and a lovely time in london. I would recommend this apartment for single people travelling together like us or a small family. Thank you Carolyn and Cheryl for having us in your lovely home! :)"
714723,3997235,2013-04-02,2331437,Patricia,:) it was a perfect stay at that flat wirh a super organisation!!
714723,4084597,2013-04-08,5581284,Hidayat,The apartment is very nice n same with the picture shown. The place is near to halal food and it easy to get public transport. The host is very nice and helpful. We did not face any problem when staying there.. Tq once again and i really recommended the place to anybody who visit London with family.
714723,4152745,2013-04-14,5478781,Kate,"Great stay at Carolyn's place. The flat was as nice as it looks on the pictures. Carolyn's sister, who welcomed us on the day of our arrival, was a really friendly host. And Carolyn has been very helpfull when we were planning our transports to London. We warmly recommend this place."
714723,4265577,2013-04-23,4867912,Alessia,"Great flat and great host. Carolyn and her sister Cheryl are both extremely kind and helpful. The flat is very near to the DLR and in max. 20 min. you are downtown. Very near to Shoreditch/Hoxton/Brick Lane too.<br/>We used to travel with 2 kids and they enjoyed the stay very much because of the garden in the backyard and all the toys at their disposal in the second chamber.<br/>Super recommended!  Thank you Carolyn, we had a wonderful time."
714723,4513980,2013-05-10,4626193,Anne-Claire,Beautiful apartment as just in the photos and Carolyn's flat is as in the description and 200% in accordance with our expectations. So we had a really good time in London! Thanks also to Cheryl!
714723,4627110,2013-05-16,2117439,Darryl,"We had a wonderful stay at Caroline's flat.  The location in east London is accessible via the Shadwell Station and makes for an easy commute to anywhere in the city.  While we didn't spend a lot of time in the loft, the space was well decorated and very comfortable.  <br/><br/>Communication with Caroline and her sister was easy, and the stay was a success!  Thanks to Caroline for providing such a livable location!"
714723,4692851,2013-05-20,6340121,Debby,"Really nice place - loved the little garden space where we had many meals. The owner's sister lives in the area and was VERY accommodating, generous with her time and with helpful information. I'm a light sleeper and appreciated that the bedrooms are downstairs and very quiet. The apartment is very warm and homey feeling. I highly recommend it. Easy walk to public transportation and a (10 minute ?) walk to a good grocery store. "
714723,4771130,2013-05-25,2538563,Melanie,"Great flat, close to Tower Bridge and St Katherine's Dock.  Buses, tube station and DLR just around the corner.  Carolyn includes a great information package with tips on transport / restaurants and info that usually locals would only be privy to.  Comfortable and clean digs...everything as described including SKY TV and free WIFI.  Carolyn was a pleasure to deal with as was her sister Cheryl, who checked us in and was our contact during our stay.  "
714723,4920274,2013-06-02,1304904,Vibhav,"My family and I stayed at Carolyn's flat for one week, and we really enjoyed our stay. We felt immediately at home. The flat was clean, organized, spacious, bright, and tastefully decorated. (I loved the artwork and big Karlsson wall clock!) The kitchen was amply stocked, and we managed to cook a meal or two -- we also appreciated the breakfast welcome kit. Carolyn and I communicated a handful of times before and during the stay. In London, Carolyn's sister, Cheryl, was our main point of contact. Both were a pleasure to interact with and promptly responded to any questions we had.   I won't hesitate to recommend the flat to others. I, myself, look forward to returning soon."
714723,5035763,2013-06-09,3939199,Dave,"We were a family of four adults who spent a delightful week in Carolyn's flat.  It was so nice to have a ""home"" to come back to after a day of exploring London.  The flat itself is comfortable and well furnished, including a kitchen full of appliances, dishes, etc.  And it is well located -- 15 minutes walk down a busy road to Tower Bridge (though we recommend taking the slightly longer and much quieter walk through the St. Katharine Docks area), 5 minutes from the DLR rail station, minutes from dozens of little shops and restaurants.  Carolyn left a very detailed description of local services and things to do -- very helpful.  Check out Wilton's Music Hall for a show if something is playing during your stay -- beautiful hall, lots of history, 5 minutes walk from the flat!<br/>"
714723,5241039,2013-06-20,5507962,Eugenia,"The place just feels like home, nice / clean with everything you need ! It was better than my expectation and you can tell how much effort the owner has put in the place ; a very pleasant experience and would definitely go back again next time!!!"
714723,5344301,2013-06-25,2568488,Ben,Had a great time in London. The flat is exactly as shown in the pictures. It was clean and well decorated. The kitchen was fully equipped.  The place has everything you need. The weather was a bit cold and rainy so we didn't use the backyard garden but it was quite a nice feature (and view).<br/><br/>The flat is near Shadwell (2-3 minute walk) station making it convenient to get into the heart of London.<br/><br/>The location is more residential so it is a bit quiet which could be a good or bad thing depending on what you were looking for. It was fine for us.<br/><br/>Caroyln's sister met us at the flat (with a bit of food for dinner - which was so nice!) and she was really great. <br/><br/>Overall we enjoyed our stay and the place was great.
714723,5721055,2013-07-13,7001404,Tasha,"Super super lovely flat! Thanks for Carolyn and her sister Cheryl, I didn't meet Carolyn for she is in New York, but her sister Cheryl introduced all details about our living in this house and London, they are super nice, and the flat is so sweet with beautiful deco, really like a home, we had breakfast in the garden everyday, such a pleased memory in London."
714723,6529027,2013-08-16,5642202,Robert,"I am so happy to be leaving this review of Carolyn's two bedroom flat near Tower Bridge.  This great experience started even before booking the reservation. I had a few questions that I sent to Carolyn and she responded immediately with the information that I needed. We communicated often throughout the process and she always replied quickly. She arranged for our transportation to and from the airport and was just a phone call, text or e-mail away. The flat itself worked perfectly for us. We traveled to London to celebrate our daughters college graduation so we needed a place that was comfortable for the three of us. This flat fit the bill perfectly. Carolyn and her sister met us at the flat and showed us everything that we needed to know. Prior to that, she had sent us an informational sheet pertaining to contact numbers, travel within London, things to see and do, etc. It was truly a pleasant experience for us because we are not real experienced travelers. The flat is in a convenient location for exploring London. The first day or two we just walked to the Tower Bridge and then as we got braver with the tubes, we found the station that was just a few minutes walk from the flat and used that for the remainder of our visit. The flat is very well equipped with everything that you might need. We liked it because we could make our own light meals when we wanted and we could just come and go as we pleased. We kept a supply of food and drink in the fridge and made our tea each morning.  There is a grocer close by as well. The flat is equipped with converter plugs, tube maps, street maps, Oyster cards that you can top up,to use on the tubes, wi-if, good television, and pretty much every thing you could need. To close, I want to thank Carolyn and her sister for everything. You guys are terrific!! I recommend to anyone going to London to consider this flat. It is functional and affordable. "
714723,6609986,2013-08-19,4511555,Stefan,"We stayed there with my parents, and had an amazing time in London. The great experience with Carolyn started a couple of weeks before we travelled to London. After the booking of the flat, Carolyn arranged the transport from and to the airport for us four. She sent us a information sheet about how the things are going in the flat, and what we can do around the appartment, e.g. where you can have lunch or where we can find the next  supermarket. The flat was very lovely , nice deco and a marvellous garden. , We felt like home there. Cheryll, Carolyns sister gave us a very warm welcome and introduced us about the appartment and London. For the first day she recommend us some places of interest and some pubs where we can have dinner. Furthermore she had a welcome package with chips, bread, eggs and milk for the first time in the appartment. For our next time in London we would definitly stay there again. To close i will thank Carolyn and here sister for everything they have done for us. You guys were terrific. Thanks a lot!!<br/>"
714723,6778267,2013-08-25,5912441,Philip,My wife and I stayed with our two teen daughters and had a great time going to and from this two bedroom flat. QUIET and RESTFUL. The garden was a special touch - much appreciated in the evening with candles and wine! 
714723,6890272,2013-08-29,6479462,Gunda,"We had a very good time at Carolyn's apartment. Nigel gave us a warm welcome, the kitchen is well equipped, we liked it a lot.<br/>I would definetely consider staying there again !"
714723,7578594,2013-09-25,7144874,John,"We have just had 9 nights at Carolyn's apartment with our 6 month old son.<br/>Carolyn was soooo helpful with all of my silly questions and was happy to assist with our request for babysitter advice (thank god for Janice, she was great!).<br/>The apartment itself is exactly how it reads and looks.<br/>Great location on the East side and only 1 stop on the DLR from Bank tube station. From here you can get wherever you like.<br/>Do yourself a favour and try some of the local restaurants, especially Lahore kebab House and Madina Grill (just a few doors up).<br/>You must also take the walk through Wapping and St Katherine dock to Tower Bridge. A great way to spend and morning. Plenty of good coffee on the way!<br/>Definitely a great place to stay and explore London."
714723,7742460,2013-10-01,8013333,Christina,"The flat is large with everything that a family could want. The description about the door locks seemed difficult when I read them, but when I saw the locks in person, they were very easy to understand. The living room was a bit dark at night, probably because former tenants have left lights on all the time, so if you have a book light, bring it. Our children loved the toys and books in the flat, and the sound machine worked well for them in the front bedroom. My husband and I are both from a large metropolitan area and were aware that the neighborhood is okay during the day, but a bit sketchy at night. "
714723,7867752,2013-10-07,5343244,Jules,"Carolyn was great with communication all the way and she left us with some fantastic information about places around the area that we would never have discovered otherwise. Especially the Captain Kidd on the river in Wapping.<br/>Despite the misunderstanding about the arrival time, Cheryl's arrival pack of basic food essentials and instructions on where everything was and how it worked was fantastic too.<br/>The location was nice and handy to the DLR which meant you could get to the city centre and all the sites in no time at all. <br/>The apartment was very well equipped and nicely decorated so we felt at home very quickly. Lots of wardrobe and storage space too - great for being able to pack all your stuff out of site so you don't feel like you're living out of a suitcase. Main bedroom is a great size but both kids in the second room was a bit of a squeeze. <br/>We thought the place was great and we'd highly recommend it."
714723,9243867,2013-12-16,6668953,Mat,My family had a great time at Carolyn's flat. It was in the perfect location for us and communication was great for the entire stay. We'll be back for sure!
714723,9499653,2013-12-31,5226621,Yves,"We had a lovely 4 day stay in Carolyn""s flat just after Christmas. ((2 adults and 2 children  aged7&8).i it was nice to be within walking distance of Tower Bridge and the Tower of London and a quick ride by bus or train/tube into the center. Carolyn's sister Cheryl couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful when we arrived. It was very easy to arrange for arrival and departure times. Carolyn was also very helpful and ready to answaer any questions we had. The flat was very cosy, nicely decorated, and extremely well equipped.  It was even nicer than we expected ....especially the downstairs area. As the weather was cold we didńt take advantage of the garden but it must be nice in the summer.  We have no hesitation in recommending the flat !"
714723,9639699,2014-01-04,9580361,Martine,"We had great experience! A beautiful home, perfect in balance and a lovely sister who opened the door for us and showed us the appartment. The surroundings are perfect! Walk via st. Katherines docks to the Tower Bridge and don't forget to drink a pint in the captains kidd pub. What we also loved was te fact that the appartment was close to shoreditch, a very cool neighbourhood. We truly recommend this place and would love to come back some other time!"
714723,9721237,2014-01-06,3934392,Karl,Great for our family weekend in London. The host is really thoughtful and there were lots of nice touches.
714723,10065382,2014-01-28,1163360,Laura,"First time in this part of London, and it has been a great experience. Communication with Carolyne always easy and quick. The apartment is exactly as it looks in the pictures, with everything you need for your stay (kitchen fully equipped, towels, etc), and the whole flat is beautifully decorated. We wanted to visit Brick Lane and Shoreditch, as two of the most vibrant and creatives neighborhoods, location was perfect too. <br/>Guidelines from Carolyne were very interesting and helpfull, we loved Wilton's! (you have to go!). We`ll come back to London and definitely we'll try to come back to Carolyne's. Thank you! "
714723,10457679,2014-02-19,11989616,Hayley,"Carolyn was a delightful host. She has a lovely, comfortable, tastefully decorated home very close to local shops and public transport. Carolyn is also easily contactable if need be. I will recommend her to others."

714723,11213537,2014-03-25,9114299,Karen,"The apartment was just perfect, very cosy,really nicely decorated and with a lovely enclosed safe back garden for our 2 boys.<br/>The location is really great to get buses into the centre and to walk up around brick lane and spitalfields market.<br/>there are parks behind the apartment and in wapping nearby,plenty of restaurants there too.<br/>the host was always prompt,friendly and professional with any correspondence.<br/>There was a lovely lady who looks after the cleaning the apartment there to greet us when we arrived and the apartment was in perfect condition.<br/>Also which was really handy for us the host has everything you might need but not bring with you for ie plastic tubs for snacks, plastic beakers etc for children."
714723,11465399,2014-04-04,11626827,Monika,We spent one week at Carolyn's flat and had a wonderful time. We could always reach out to her for any question with direct response. The flat looked exactly like in the pictures. It was very clean and equipped with everything you need for a longer stay. The flat is perfect for a trip to London. Well located with a nice little garden. We'll recommend this place to all of our friends. Thanks again to Carolyn!
714723,11593092,2014-04-08,13063609,Michael,"Very nice flat. Ideal base for getting to all the London attractions, underground and buses just a short walk away. We would use again. Highly recommended."
714723,11711991,2014-04-13,1667675,Simon,"We had a great time at Carolyn's flat and she was very flexible concerning our arrival time. It was clean, cosy, in a quiet neighborhood and very close to public transports. <br/>Carolyn's recommendations are very helpful (the Lahore Kebab House has really delicious indian food!).<br/>We would definitely come back to this apartment! Thank you!"
714723,11826280,2014-04-16,2033117,Arnaud,"Nicely decorated, well equipped and very comfortable apartment: this was a perfect choice in a convenient location for a long week-end with our 2 kids. Carolyn's tips to get around were very helpful and relevant. "
714723,12603708,2014-05-06,11030279,Carlo Maria,"Bella casetta, molto comoda in Londra. A 10' a piedi dalle stazioni di TowerBridge e Aldgate, dove passano molte linee della Metropolitana. Comoda anche per chi arriva da London City Airport. Vicinissima ai Docks. Zona tranquilla, il che è un bene. Certamente la nostra base anche per i prossimi viaggi a Londra!"
714723,12817851,2014-05-12,12341733,Paul,Our host (sister of Carolyn) was amazing. Very accommodating and extremely helpful. We were met by the person that cleans the property which was a nice touch. <br/>The location was central and handy to the DLR. <br/>Overall the property was even better than expected! Very clean and well appointed - we instantly felt at home. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely return. 
714723,13318253,2014-05-25,1423359,Sophie,"This is a very attractively furnished and arranged flat, with everything you can think of provided. Very comfortable and well appointed. Great little garden. Carolyn has prepared a super book of information and instructions. This is also a good location. It's quick to get into more central parts of the city, and its proximity to the river with all the new development (and old history), and to other vibrant parts of the east end, make it a good choice for an un-touristy experience. Communication back and forth was a breeze - Carolyn was quite patient with our (sometimes very basic!) questions and keen to make sure we were happily settled and that all went smoothly. "
714723,13499809,2014-05-29,9581227,Meg,"Carolyn's place was fantastic. The flat was so homey and cozy. The private garden in the back was icing on the cake. Comfortable beds, great location. Absolutely no hesitations recommending it to others. Susana, who let us in, waited for an hour for us because of a delayed flight and she didn't complain at all. Thanks, Carolyn!"
714723,13815284,2014-06-05,13297702,Tahera,Myself and my friends had a lovely time here. The area was great and so many little shops and places to visit!  Absolutely loved how spacious the flat was and i was happy that we were just left to ourselves with the apartment. Felt like it was our own place. Would definately love to stay again next time i'm in London
714723,14727816,2014-06-25,11181213,Diane,"What a wonderful time we had here! Carolyn was a fun, responsive host, and the packet of information she sent in advance was very useful. This flat was a lovely home base for us during our week in London. The weather during our stay was great, so we particularly enjoyed the patio/garden. That was our favorite amenity: the private outdoor space. It was a relaxing, pretty place to begin and end our busy days.  <br/><br/>The flat itself is cozy, attractive, very clean, and well represented by the photos here. Both bedrooms are quite comfortable, the bathroom is nice, and the kitchen well furnished. The neighborhood may look slightly dodgy at first, but it proved to be very quiet, and we never felt uncomfortable during our many walks in the area.<br/><br/>Thanks to Carolyn's notes and advice, we were able to get our bearings in the neighborhood quickly, and we easily found our way to the nearest DLR and Tube stops. It was great being so close to Tower Bridge and the Tower of London! On Carolyn’s recommendation, we had a fantastic meal at Lahore Kebab House, and the Captain Kidd is a gorgeous riverside place to enjoy a pint (skip the food, though). Other favorite places we found within easy walking distance were The Empress restaurant on Leman street (amazing Indian food!) and The Minories pub, near the Tower Hill station, which we made our “local.”  We had the BEST full English breakfast there (highly recommended!), and some excellent cask ales.<br/><br/>We became very fond of this flat during our stay and would happily return. We recommend it! <br/>"
714723,14905352,2014-06-29,9549302,Arturo,"We are very happy, we all expectations are met. The house is very comfortable and clean and in perfect condition, I recommend it for families."
714723,15086663,2014-07-02,11983306,Rachel,"We loved Carolyn's garden flat in Tower Bridge, it was perfect and in a great location for all the city sights. The printed manual was also really helpful. Would definitely recommend it to friends and would love to stay again if we are back in London any time soon. "
714723,17264607,2014-08-10,13607029,Rudi,"We instantly felt at home at Carolyn’s place. Carolyn’s sister Cheryl gave us a really warm welcome and explained us all the basics. And Carolyn's printed recommendations are very helpful indeed. The flat itself looks just as good as on the photos here and provides all the small necessities of a comfy life AND a great coffee machine. ;)<br/>This is the perfect place for a wonderfully stress-free stay with kids in London: Close to public transport and tourist attractions, but also a peaceful and green refuge in the busy city.<br/>We enjoyed our stay and would definitely return!"
714723,17746246,2014-08-17,14749355,Val,"Thank you Carolyn for all the quick efficient emails received prior to my stay at your wonderful apartment in London. We stayed 5 nights & quickly worked out which trains to take, where nearest necessities were & what to do thanks to out Hosts information. We were met by Susanna at apartment & everything was as noted on website. Any queries I had were a quick email answered immediately. The apartment/unit was very spacious with new kitchen, washing machine. ( a big plus), hot water for showers, comfy beds, & a little garden to sit in weather permitting. I would definitely recommend this Unit to anyone looking for accommodation not in a hotel. Than you Carolyn for sharing your London home   The rest of the worldly travellers!"
714723,18080220,2014-08-21,18059545,Mary,My family of four stayed in Carolyn's Flat near Tower Bridge. We found that bus #15 (used the most) was only a few blocks away. The flat was ready for check in just as promised. We were met by the cleaning lady and it was spotless. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed to make meals. The grocery store was within walking distance. A very nice manual was left to answer all of our questions. This flat was very convenient for our family and we would stay again if we ever get back to London. 
714723,18463939,2014-08-27,2193538,Kelly,"Staying at Carolyns place was great. Location is fantastic, beds super comfy, shower amazing and all the comforts of home. We didnt meet Carolyn however her sister Cheryl met us and orientated us beautifully! Carolyn also organised a super smooth Heathrow pick up for us also. <br/>Loved staying here and definately would again!!"
714723,19021260,2014-09-05,12530957,Jim,The Flat was great and everything was as advertised.  Carolyn provided detailed and timely responses to all my questions prior to and during our stay. The amenities where great and the location provides easy access to transit and a pleasant neighborhood surprise (The Mahogany Bar at the Wilton's Music Hall) thanks to Carolyn's suggestion. We also took up Carolyn on coordinating transportation from Heathrow to the Flat which made sense since 4 of us were traveling with luggage.  Thanks again Carolyn for a great Stay.
714723,20033349,2014-09-22,20446206,Zenja,"<br/>We were 4 people in the apartment. Apartment is spacy and really good, has all you can need and close to public transportation.<br/>It was easy to reach all tourists places and shopping.<br/>Carolyn provided in advance fantastic guide with information about transportation, apartment, surroundings, tourist information, shops .. really all you need.<br/>She was as well very helpful with organizing transport from airport and providing late check in and very fast in answering on all our questions before and during our stay.<br/>"
714723,20952562,2014-10-08,19953537,Kati,"Kodikas asunto kahdessa kerroksessa, hyvin varustettu, kauniisti sisustettu ja siisti koti, lisäksi pieni muurien ympäröimä sisäpiha. Asuinalue ei erityisen viehättävä mutta ihan asiallinen, ainoa ongelma ettei kunnon ruokakauppaa ole ihan lähettyvillä. "
714723,21338768,2014-10-15,12213717,Lene,"Vi tilbragte en uge i Carolyns lejlighed i London. Vores ophold i London var første gang, vi lejede igennem airbnb, og Carolyns lejlighed var et super godt valg!<br/>Lejligheden er hyggelig, ren og godt udstyret. Den var dejlig rummelig til en familie på 4, og alt var som beskrevet på airbnb's hjemmeside. En god base for en familie, som har brug for også at slappe lidt af i hjemlige omgivelser imellem byturene.<br/>Carolyn er en fantastisk vært, som sendte et informationshæfte forud for vores ophold, med grundig information om lejligheden, området sat transport. <br/>Carolyns hurtige svar på emails, samt hendes imødekommenhed og venlighed gjorde det meget betryggende og en stor fornøjelse, at kommunikere med hende. <br/>Lejligheden ligger i et dejligt roligt område - tæt på undergrunden, hvorfra man hurtigt kommer til byen samt til diverse seværdigheder.<br/>Vi vil bestemt anbefale Carolyns 2 bed garden flat til andre, og vender meget gerne tilbage en anden gang."
714723,22227140,2014-11-02,5430765,Daisy,"Carolyn's little flat was every bit as cute as it seems. Comfortable and warm, it even felt spacious when there were 5 of us staying there for a short time during our stay. The awesome espresso machine was the star of the tiny kitchen, still there were an impressive amount of other appliances and cooking accoutrements that managed to fit in a non-cluttery and orderly way.    <br/>It was clear that, though she was out of the country for the duration of our stay, Carolyn was absolutely invested in our comfort and enjoyment of London. We really appreciated her quick replies to questions and concerns. Toward the end of our stay there was a mounting concern. There was a renovation going on in the flat next to ours. Knowing she had no control over what goes on in someone else's residence, we let her know that there was jackhammering going on and the vibrations were jiggling our brains out. What do you need brains for on holiday anyway, right? She contacted the owner immediately and got us information and permission to tell the workers to move onto something less brain-jiggling while we were at home, which we did. It wasn't a perfect solution but it helped. When unexpected issues come up as they always do, it's the reaction of the host that makes the difference between a real problem and a tolerable inconvenience. We are very grateful it was the latter.  <br/>The flat is just West of the Tower Bridge and St. Katharine docks. It was pleasant to jog from the flat around the docks to the bridge and back. Best to do that early in the morning when there are just other joggers and photographers out, rather than the throngs that flood the area during touristy times of day. There is a local coffee shop, White Mulberries, at the docks which would make a nice stop on a stroll around the area.<br/>All in all, this flat was a great choice for us and we would stay here again. <br/>"
714723,22500912,2014-11-08,1328528,Minas,We stayed at Carolyn apartment for 5 days and we were 4 persons. It was really easy to find the apartment. We were really surprised from this amazing apartment. Carolyn & her sister were really helpful and always next to us. <br/>
714723,22885478,2014-11-17,11807079,Sum Kei Stephanie,"Carolyn was a great host,she did gave us a lot of information and advice,and quick response before and during the trip.<br/>Although i personally cant go on the trip at the end,but my friends who staying in their house said that the house was very nice,clean and easy to get on the transportation.we will definitely stay in her house again "
714723,23103621,2014-11-23,22389320,Valentine,"Nous avons séjourné a 4 personnes dans cet appartement. <br/>Carolyn a tout d'abord été très disponible. Je ne l'ai pas rencontré mais nous avons échangé une bonne correspondance par email.<br/>Elle a fait un topo bien détaillé de l'appartement, du quartier et des choses a faire.<br/>Appartement charmant, propre, cosy et bien chaud !<br/>De plus il est très bien situé.<br/>La station de métro Shadwell est a 5 minutes a pied, et nous avons tout fait depuis là.<br/>Très bonne expérience, merci Carolyn :) "
714723,25707398,2015-01-24,23228436,Alan,"We had a lovely stay in Carolyn's home.   The house was very warm and cosy during our London Winter visit.    The DLR around the corner made accessing Central London very easy and when you cross the Highway into Wapping, there are several lovely English pubs within a 10 minute walk.   Carolyn was a great host who left comprehensive instructions and tips, was in touch regularly to see if we needed anything and we were greeted warmly by Carolyn's sister Cheryl on our arrival.    "
714723,27122777,2015-02-26,24033749,Flora,房東Carolyn很貼心，會主動在事前與我們聯繫，幫我們預定好計程車(這真的很棒，因為我們的班機時間是早到晚走，如果沒有Carolyn的幫忙，可能就要擔心趕不上飛機，或是必須花很多力氣研究英國的計程車預約網站)。<br/>雖然我們這次去的時候剛好沒有遇到Carolyn，但是她有很盡責了請了一位朋友在房子等我們，為我們解說租屋環境､各項家電用品的使用方式，甚至還帶我們走到附近的地鐵站及超商!<br/>這間屋子大體而言很棒，室內有暖氣(而且可以定時)，讓我們從寒冷的戶外回來能夠暖暖身子，廚房的設備也很齊全(可惜我們的行程比較趕，沒有時間自己料理，不然一定很棒)，房子也整理得很乾淨，唯一的小缺點應該是大門很窄(不過這應該是房屋的結構問題，整排的房子大門似乎都是這麼狹窄)，門鎖稍微比較需要花時間開啟，這是比較美中不足的地方。
714723,27389965,2015-03-03,25933127,Silvia,"Esperienza molto positiva.<br/>Il mio host non era fisicamente presente a Londra, ma aveva organizzato tutto nei minimi dettagli: una persona ad accogliere, istruzioni sul funzionamento della casa e sui luoghi da visitare a disposizione (anche anticipate via email nei giorni precedenti), possibilità di contattare in ogni momento l'host via email o per telefono (prima e durante la permanenza a Londra).<br/>La casa è molto comoda e curata, accogliente, funzionale (c'è tutto quello che può servire!) e ogni cosa è funzionante; si trova in una posizione non centralissima ma a cinque minuti a piedi dalla metropolitana. Il quartiere è tranquillo e con tutti i servizi a pochi minuti da casa. Abbiamo avuto un solo piccolo inconveniente con la caldaia, risolto immediatamente dall'host che ha mandato un tecnico a sistemare il guasto: considerando che l'host era a mille miglia da Londra e il guasto è stato risolto in tempo reale, direi che l'assistenza è più che garantita!<br/>Le istruzioni fornite dall'host sono dettagliate e complete, praticamente una guida della casa, dei dintorni da visitare e di tutti i mezzi di trasporto; ogni cosa consigliata è stata fatta e siamo stati molto contenti perché era proprio quello che desideravamo fare/vedere.<br/>E' stata la nostra prima esperienza di questo tipo e siamo stati del tutto soddisatti. Senza dubbio da ripetere!"
714723,29089665,2015-04-04,23813814,Birgit,"Die Wohnung war wie beschrieben: sehr sauber, alles vorhanden was nötig war, tolle Lage zu Stadt, wir fühlten uns wohl. Anfangs Probleme  mit der Absprache bei der Ankunft, konnten es dann gemeinsam beheben. Für uns Fünf war es ein sehr schöner Londonaufenthalt ! "
714723,29655262,2015-04-11,24271983,Lou,"My wife, my daughter and I had a wonderful stay at Carolyns flat.  It was clean, quiet and comfortable. Her sister greated us and went over the top by purchasing us some basics, eggs, bread, milk etc.. Very nice place!"
714723,30494732,2015-04-23,27053911,Kiril,"This was my first time renting a place via airbnb and it was definitely a very nice experience, a great deal because of Carolyn. She was very nice and helpful and provided us (me, my girlfriend and her parents) with lots of helpful information not only regarding her place but for our stay in London. <br/><br/>The apartment is very comfortable and warm. You have everything you need. The DLR (public transportation) is just around the corner. There are also a lot small and some bigger convenience stores nearby."
714723,31161012,2015-05-03,25049706,Sophie,"L'appartement est typiquement anglais, avec du charme et une jolie décoration.<br/>Il est conforme à la description, et est bien équipé.<br/>L'appartement est proche des transports dans un quartier intermédiaire entre les Docks et Whitechapel."

714723,33424421,2015-05-28,24970954,Jean-Pierre,"Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour à Londres. Nous avons passés 4 nuits dans l'appartement de Carolyn. Il a totalement répondu à nos attentes, bien équipé, agréable à vivre et bien situé (à 15 minutes à pied de Tower Bridge par un ballade sympa le long du canal de Kathrine docks). On a apprécié de prendre nos petits déjeunés dans le jardin. Nous n'avons pas rencontré Carolyn, mais elle a toujours été très réactive pour répondre à nos mails. Susannah nous a très bien reçu lors de notre arrivée.  Adresse à recommander."
714723,34928907,2015-06-14,19569657,Brenda,We stayed in this flat for 5 days. It is just as described. The owners are wonderful. She booked us a cab from airport and gave us so much useful information about London. The flat is lovely. 
714723,35701716,2015-06-21,27038648,Ruth,"Ah, the flat was SO perfect, so beautifully equipped with everything we could possibly need, and a garden to enjoy as well with the perfect weather we were lucky to have.   We also just want to thank you for the incredible thoughtfulness in bringing us eggs, milk and bread which really helped us as we were indeed tired after a long flight. It is extras like these that make a lasting impression.<br/><br/>My mom told me to say she has NEVER slept in such incredibly comfortable beds nor on such extraordinary wonderful pillows - and this from someone who takes her own pillow wherever she goes, being the original ""princess and the pea"".<br/><br/>All together, it was just perfect for us and we are most grateful and would certainly recommend them whole heartedly."
714723,36078590,2015-06-25,7351639,Armon,"Carolyn did a great job helping us from the moment we booked our stay. She was continuously helpful in giving us directions from the airport, around town, to sights. Very communicative and easy to work with. The apartment was very cute and clean, with relatively easy access to the west side of town."
714723,38092005,2015-07-13,5787263,Serge,"We had a wonderful  experience at Carolyn's flat. It is exactly as described in the listing and photos. It is very clean and comfortable, and roomy enough for our family of 4. We really appreciated that it is fully equipped so we could cook and eat at home when we wanted. It was particularly hot for a few days, but the flat and particulalrly the bedrooms in the basement stayed cool. The back garden was great to unwind with a drink! It really felt like a home away from home. Carolyn was very helpful, and provided us with a lot of very useful information and tips ahead of our trip. She also booked a cab for us to and from the airport, saving us the hassle. Carolyn's sister welcomed us to the flat, and very thoughtfully provided us with some basic food to get us started. <br/>We definitely recommend Carolyn's flat. Thanks!"
714723,40554948,2015-08-01,26427293,B. Joyce,"Yes, the description was accurate.  Carolyn and Cheryl were very gracious and welcoming to us.  One could not hope for more accommodating hosts."
714723,46901189,2015-09-14,9199925,Eberhard,Organisatorisch hat alles sehr gut geklappt. wir konnten zur vereinbarten Zeit in die Wohnung. Die Wohnung war sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Alles war sauber und wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. 
714723,48082798,2015-09-23,35252233,Kimberly,"We never had the opportunity to meet Carolyn, although her sister Cheryl warmly greeted us upon arrival.  Carolyn arranged for a car to pick us up at Gatwick which made it very easy to get to the apartment.  The apartment appears in person just as in pictures and is over all a comfortable space.  Communication with Carolyn is excellent from booking as well as throughout this stay.  "

It made us feel at home. It is easy access to tubes and the supermarket is nearby. Definitely recommended."
714723,58776250,2016-01-05,34068822,Fritz Johannes,"Wir hatten das Vergnügen, über Silvester bei Carolyn wohnen zu dürfen. Die Kommunikation mit ihr klappte bereits im Vorfeld einwandfrei. So schickte sie uns bereits Beschreibungen, wie man am besten zur Wohnung kommt und was man in der Umgebung alles machen kann. Leider war sie bei der Übergabe selbst nicht anwesend, was aber nichts ausmachte, da ihre Reinigungskraft uns hereinließ und die Wohnung zeigte. Die Wohnung war sehr stylisch eingerichtet und es war alles vorhanden, was man braucht. Insgesamt gefiel uns die Wohnung sehr gut und wir werden diese auf jeden Fall weiter empfehlen."
714723,62004215,2016-02-10,15363989,Peter,Wir sind restlos begeistert von Carolyns Appartement. Alles war genau wie beschrieben. Sehr großzügig und sauber. Der Empfang durch Carolyns Schwester Cheryl war herzlich und wir fühlten uns von Anfang an wohl. Die Verbindung zur City ist gut (DLR-Haltestelle Shadwell). Jederzeit wieder.

It had everything we needed and Carolyn provided ample detailed information about the flat and tips for shopping, restaurants and sightseeing. Our only wish was that the weather had been better so we could enjoy the delightful private garden out back. We will definitely recommend this place."

714723,73075834,2016-05-06,26275041,Winta,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was absolutely amazing. When we arrived, we very late checking in but Cheryl, Carolyn's sister, was so nice and understanding about the London traffic.  She walked us through the flat, letting us know important things regarding the home and answered any questions we had.  The flat is wonderful and is very charming. Its very close to public transportation which can take you to any part of London you'd like.  It's furnished perfectly, with art on almost every wall.  The beds were very comfortable, which helped after a long 10 hour flight. Carolyn checked in with us via Airbnb messages but we were mostly left to our own devices.  I had an issue with checking out since our flight was really early in the morning, and Carolyn was able to resolve our issues swiftly.  I would recommend this flat to anyone using the Airbnb service simply because of its wonderful owner and beautiful yet comfortable home."
714723,74394519,2016-05-15,56409417,Vicky,La casa de Carolyn esta preparada para las necesidades de quien la visita. La ubicación es muy buena. La hermana de Carolyn fue muy agradable y atenta. Es departamento es muy lindo y cómodo. Muy recomendable
714723,92748635,2016-08-09,15973527,Tara,"We really enjoyed our time in Carolyn's flat. It was the perfect size for the four of us staying there. We loved having access to the private garden and cozy living room to relax in after a long day of sightseeing. <br/>The flat was a simple 12 minute walk to the Tower Bridge/Tower of London/Tower Hill Station area, and we could get anywhere we needed to from there, either by bus or underground. <br/>Carolyn was very easy to get in touch with and she arranged for her housekeeper to meet us straight from the airport, even though it was before check-in time. We really appreciated that!<br/>There is a good hairdryer and curling iron in the flat, which was a bonus for the women staying there! We'd definitely recommend this place for a great stay in London. "
714723,96417983,2016-08-22,20466274,Kirsten,"Carolyn und Dan sind super nette Gastgeber, die sich um alles kümmern. Kann man nur weiter empfehlen. Wohnung war exakt wie beschrieben.

714723,114732356,2016-11-20,12779164,Efrat,Beautiful and clean apartment. Looks exactly like it's shown in Airbnb website. Great location for guests that like to see East London's neighborhoods. The contact with Carolyn was perfect and so were the very detailed instructions she gave us - very useful. We hope to come again someday.
714723,115853345,2016-11-27,32850813,Satinder,"This apartment was exactly as described, and in a really great location, close to small convenience stores, the subway and the overground.  The beds were comfortable, there were plenty of clean towels, and the street was generally quite quiet. <br/><br/>Carolyn was really accommodating; our flight arrived late at night and she organised for her housekeeper to be there to meet us, answer any questions and generally show us around and make sure we were settled.  Carolyn communicated frequently before our arrival to make sure of times, checked in whilst we were there, and was really easy and lovely to talk to.  "

714723,123035328,2016-12-27,38543328,Ellen,"We had a wonderful time in London. Carolyn's flat was exactly as pictured. She and her husband were very helpful with check in, letting us in early as our flight got in in the morning. She also booked us a cab from Heathrow, which I recommend if there are a few people travelling. Not having to battle with luggage and unfamiliar trains after a 25 hour journey was a relief!<br/><br/>Excellent dinner to be had at Il Bordello (down the road in Wapping) and great service & food at Efes Turkish restaurant. <br/><br/>One thing to note is that this is an East London suburb, so some parts were a little ""edgy"" (as my mum put it), but it's so close to wonderful sights that we didn't mind!"

714723,126250594,2017-01-10,30083286,Mike,The apartment was in a great spot & had everything a family of 4 could ask for. It was warm & cosy & carolyn & her husband were super helpful. The place is clearly regularly used so has everything u can possibly need.   Hence our stay was smooth & stress free due to things such as a washing machine & a fully equipped kitchen. 
714723,127160129,2017-01-16,99490310,Hayley,The flat was perfect for our London adventure. We were close enough to walk to pubs or other restaurants and only a short Uber ride away from some of London's best attractions. The flat was clean and modern and offered plenty of space for four girls to get ready at the same time in the morning. Carolyn provided a binder full of helpful information with some of the best things to do while visiting. We found the binder very resourceful. Highly recommend! 
714723,129346504,2017-01-30,80746414,Aivars,"The apartment was very good, just as in pictures, there was everything that was mentioned. Comunication with hosts was very good, they were very helpfull. Not too far from public transport. "

There was good communication from Carolyn and although we didn't get to meet her,she phoned me and arranged for her housekeeper to meet us at the property.<br/>If I have anything negative to say at all,it  that the road noise was audible in the front bedroom whilst the back bedroom was much quieter. Not a great deal anyone can do about this. Apart from that we had a great stay."
714723,136212795,2017-03-09,6128976,Venelina,"We had great stay in Carolyn's apartment. It is located in central London, Whitechapel, 2min (walking distance) to DLR and Overground stations and 15 min away (walking distance) to Tower Hill underground and Tower of London and Tower Bridge. There are plenty of bars and restaurants near Tower Hill and Bank stations, and also many kebap houses and supermarkets around the apartment. Its pretty safe neighborhood as well. The apartment is as photographed, cosy and clean. The garden is amazing. You have everything needed in your disposal including coffee and tea. We loved our stay in the apartment. Carolyn is a great host, had really good communication. She helped us prior to the visit with lots of helpful information. Highly recommended!"

714723,154773053,2017-05-26,16463201,Myounga,I stayed at Carolyn's for 8nights and we had great time there. So convenient with public transportation and nice neighborhoods. Everything we needed was perfectly equipped in the kitchen or everywhere in the house and the little garden from the back door  is so nice for freshing up in the morning. It was just so great!! 
714723,160208767,2017-06-13,116984328,Caterina,"Appartamento molto carino, accogliente e ben accessoriato. Eravamo in 4 e ci siamo trovati benissimo.

The apartment is spacious, well equipped and clean with a lovely garden in the backyard. The beds were very comfortable, the shower was equipped with towels and toiletries and every part of the kitchen was in full working order. We were able to do a load of laundry as well! The accommodations are very family friendly and excellent for large groups. The location is close to the tube, bus, and walkable to The Tower Bridge and the London Tower. We highly recommend this place to anyone who will stay in London and we would definitely come back again! Thanks very much to Carolyn and her husband. "

So we've had a very pleasant stay. <br/><br/>On first sight we thought that the location wasn't that great. But it turned out we were close to cool areas like Shoreditch and Wapping.  "
714723,166952442,2017-07-05,76052649,Kristeen,This was our first time using AirBnB and Carolyn was such a helpful and gracious host.  She explained everything about the flat upon check-in and provided tons of information regarding the area and getting around London. The flat is within a 5 minute walk if the overground line and made a great base for getting around London. We enjoyed the walk to Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.  We would definitely book this flat again. 
714723,170650435,2017-07-16,114463455,Arti,"A well-equipped, comfortable apartment in the centre of London. Great place to stay and discover the city. Carolyn provided detailed information about things within and outside of the house"

Easy walk to the DLR which takes you straight into central London, quiet neighborhood, and plenty of room to spread out and make yourself feel at home. Loved our stay and would definitely consider staying here again during future visits!"

714723,243822155,2018-03-17,98325958,Katharina,"Wir haben das Appartement für einen<br/>London Urlaub mit unseren Töchtern (13 und 10 Jahre) gebucht. <br/>Die Wohnung liegt sehr zentral (15min zum Tower) an einer Straße die etwas mehr befahren ist. Ein Schlafzimmer geht zu dieser Straße (unsere Töchter haben dort aber sehr gut geschlafen, obwohl der Verkehr hörbar ist) und eines in den ruhigen Hinterhof.<br/>In der Wohnung ist alles was man braucht und noch viel mehr zu finden.<br/>Besonders begeistert waren wir von den ausführlichen Anleitungen und Tipps die Carolyn für Ihre Gäste verfasst hat.<br/><br/>Die Wohnung ist sehr zu empfehlen - wir haben uns wie zu Hause gefühlt.<br/><br/>Danke dafür!"
714723,248406497,2018-03-31,160999615,Sonja,"Charmantes und gut gelegenes Appartment. Das Elternschlafzimmer liegt ruhig. Das zweite mit dem etwas kleineren Bett liegt zur Straße und ist recht laut. Ausstattung, Sauberkeit, Übergabe, Tipps (z. B. für Taxi) sowie der Kontakt waren sehr gut. Würden wir wieder machen. Highlight ist auch der schöne Ausblick in den kleinen Garten."
714723,251214633,2018-04-07,52934898,Karen,"Die Wohnung ist sehr liebevoll eingerichtet und entspricht den Fotos. Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet. Carolyn haben wir nicht persönlich kennengelernt, sie hat jedoch eine gute Zusammenfassung aller Infos zur Wohnung und gute London-Tipps für die Gäste hinterlegt. Der zum Teil starke Straßen- und Flugverkehr störte und zeitweise."
714723,254629596,2018-04-17,69517442,Rama,"Absolutely wonderful Airbnb experience! Carolyn was so helpful and quick to respond to all of my questions, it couldn't have been easier to arrange my stay. Her Husband Danny was there to meet me on arrival and couldn't have been nicer, he is very friendly and explain all of the stuff insde the house also explain everythings we need.  <br/>The flat itself was PERFECT, and just like we need. We were 4 adults with 2 childs, still feel spacious. The flat also feel warm, homey, comfortable, super clean, also had everything you could need, and with backyard (our favorite place to smoke)! It just felt like a treat to stay there for a week :-) So many wonderful details to enjoy.<br/>The location is quite good, very safe and central, just round the corner from Shadwell station (6 minute walking) and easy to get anywhere in the city. Near McDonald, and lots of grocery store especially (asian stuff ).<br/>Great value for money and I hope to stay there again next time I visit London! Thanks Carolyn and Danny for making my stay special!"
714723,259554029,2018-05-01,83705768,Lisa,Lovely flat & good access to getting around London.<br/><br/>Walking distance to St Katherines dock for café & restaurants!
714723,267702395,2018-05-22,22369986,Jeff,"While Carolyn’s place was an overall good value there are a few things to be aware of before booking.<br/><br/> If you’re looking for a good home base to explore central London by foot, this is a bit far out of the way. Train access isn’t far though. The flat is on a busy road which is particularly evident in the second downstairs bedroom with a window right at street level. The street life right around the flat is a bit sketchy with lots of trash on the sidewalk. Walking around during the day was fine but we felt a bit uncomfortable walking back from the train station in the late evening with our kids. <br/><br/>A few of the items mentioned In the listing description and house guide were not on site, including gas barbecue and a clothes line. The garden was also overgrown, which was disappointing as we were looking forward to what would have been a nice feature.<br/><br/>The description of the flat being in Whitechapel/Brick Lane is a bit misleading and I’d say it more accurately would be in Shadwell, a short walk from the above trendier areas. <br/><br/>Carolyn was very communicative and helped us book a mini cab from the airport. If you’re looking for an affordable option for four or more it’s not a bad option, but you have to put in a bit more work to get to the main attractions in central London."
714723,282360240,2018-06-27,7618335,Burkhard,"Die Unterkunft ist sehr toll eingerichtet und ausgestattet, alles war super sauber, es war ein Genuß dort zu wohnen. Ein zusätzlicher Pluspunkt ist der Garten, den wir wegen des guten Wetters jeden Tag nutzen konnten. "
714723,295758807,2018-07-24,158473327,Raji,"Carolyn and her husband, Danny were great hosts.  Carolyn was very responsive from the time I made the reservation and was proactive in sharing very detailed information at the time I made the reservation.  Throughout the time leading up to our reservation,, she was in touch and provided information needed to make our stay a good experience.  Upon checking in, Danny was at the flat to meet us.  The flat itself was great and included all necessary amenities.  The place was clean.  However, I want to highlight a couple of things that I hope will help future guests to make a more informed decision.<br/><br/>Cannon Street ""Road"" if where this flat is.  This is different from Cannon Street, which is in the heart of London.  This is East London.  The flat is relatively close to the tower bridge, which is walking distance, but if you are with kids it will take about an hour.  Cannon Street Road is very narrow and there is no parking on that street.  It makes even a quick drop off a bit tough, specially with kids.  The other more unpleasant experience for us, which is not fault of the host, was the residents dumping garbage bags in the street.  You see a row of garbage bags on the street and causes a stench. <br/><br/>For adult travelers that are looking for a convenient place in London that is easily accessible to major attractions, this is a good place.  But if you are travelling with kids and you are looking for an environment that is kid friendly, I would not recommend this place.  "
714723,298465964,2018-07-29,1689684,Jonny,"Carolyn's apartment is exactly as listed, possibly even nicer. It was a nice haven from busy days working and a relaxing home to come to. In a good location close to transport links and has everything you would need to a short stay including a fully equipped kitchen. The beds were comfy, the place was clean and the shower was really good! Carolyn's communication was brilliant considering how up in the air my plans were and the check in was fast. Definitely a great place to stay 5/5!"
714723,322131886,2018-09-12,172076552,Sarah,Lovely apartment close to transport and walking distance from the Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.  We had a fantastic time!
714723,368844072,2019-01-08,124951894,Francois,"We had a great stay in this lovely, very nicely decorated, flat. Very comfortable, good heating, nice and comfortable bathroom, good shower pressure and water temperature.  A few minutes walk from metro station and 15min walk to White Chapel and Brick Lane, so very conveniently located for an East London stay. Carolyn and her husband Dan are very kind, welcoming, and easy to get in touch with. Great value for the money, will definitely come back!"

714723,408380449,2019-02-04,6597804,Tobias,Carolyn is a really good host and responds quickly. A wonderful flat and highly recommend. The supermarket is near and easy to reach the transportation.
714723,413883081,2019-02-18,2474720,Rachel,Carolyn’s place is so stylish and spacious! My partner and I stayed with another couple there for a long weekend in London and had a blast. Carolyn was so communicative and made our stay easy and delightful. It’s a short walk to the tube and from there we had no trouble getting anywhere in the city. Highly recommend and would love to stay here again!
714723,415296162,2019-02-22,64951762,Stephane,"It is a lovely flat, nicely decorated. Tower bridge is about fifteen minutes. It takes five minutes to go to the nearest overground station (Shadwell). We enjoyed our stay and our two girls aged 16 and 14 too. We would ask for Carolyn's flat if we go to London again. Carolyn was very reactive when we needed."
714723,424208613,2019-03-16,40664361,Kim,"Carolyn's place blew away my expectations. It was stylish and close to the tubes and was a great place to walk around. When we arrived we were in constant contact with Carolyn for an early check in and it was super easy to get ahold of her. Inside the airbnb it felt like home, great kitchen and living room and the bedrooms were cozy and warm. She even has a welcome book that details all the amenities and had tips for travel as well as recommendations for toruist sites and restaurants around the area. Thanks for a great stay, Carolyn!"
714723,431039302,2019-03-31,72501436,Genevieve,"The flat is really clean and well equipped, however, it is on a very busy street that has a lot of noisy traffic all day and all night. The bedroom in the front is like there is no window and the car would pass right through. The people that slept in that room couldn’t sleep very well. So it’s not really a 2 bedrooms airbnb. Also, the neighbourhood is okay, surely up and coming, we weren’t 100% comfortable walking there late at night."
714723,436170210,2019-04-12,46980011,Rhonda,"Carolyn's place is in a great location for exploring London, the beds are very comfy, amenities provided great and her responses to any questions super fast. The DLR is a 5 min walk away and one stop later you are at Tower Hill and can pretty much choose to go wherever you like on the underground."
714723,444120539,2019-04-27,20146324,Catarina,"Wir haben uns in der Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt. Sie ist wirklich toll ausgestattet und sehr gemütlich. Es hat uns an nix gefehlt. Wie schon vor mir geschrieben wurde: man hört den Verkehr, Flugzeuge und auch wenn jemand die Treppe in der Wohnung drüber rauf und runter geht, aber ich habe mit Ohrenstöpseln hervorragend in den tollen Betten geschlafen, und das ist bei mir keine Selbstverständlichkeit :-) Den einzigen Abzug gibt es für die Gegend. Die hat uns nicht gefallen, aber man ist wirklich sehr schnell in der Stadt, so dass ich das zu vernachlässigen finde. Carolyn war sehr nett und hat immer sofort geantwortet."
714723,450115478,2019-05-08,24623709,Willem-Jan,Great comfort at close distance from london city. Clever packaging and a full equipped kitchen really make this a fine home away  from home. Great tips and extra's for kids complete a great apartment .
714723,490874294,2019-07-19,157896615,Amy,"Carolyns place is fantastic!  There is a 10-15 minute walk into tube or town, 15 minutes to the Tower and St Katherines Dock.  We traveled with our 16 year old daughter so the 2 bedroom was perfect for a 12 day stay.  We would gladly stay there again!"
714723,588208044,2020-01-04,67347473,Tommy,Great apartment in a great location. Carolyn is easy to communicate with and made her effort to make our stay as good and convenient as possible. The pictures doesn’t do the place justice. We would love to come back

A lovely, peaceful, calm place to return to and wind down in the evenings with a book (or the TV), a glass of wine, and a hot bath.  Would definitely go back.  Wish I were still there!"

934366,12686464,2014-05-08,11104911,Dominique,"We only met the host once as we were out seeing the city every day but she was very welcoming. The studio is on the top floor of her terrace and is very private, cosy, quiet and homely. I loved our stay here and the bed was amazing. The tube station if about a 10min easy walk or there ate buses out the front so it's very easy to get around. Fulham itself is a great suburb with lots of bars, restaurants and cafe. I would recommend staying here if you are looking for a private and quiet space as mg fiancé and I were"

934366,14922954,2014-06-29,13507003,Spencer,"Sylvan was an unbelievably hospitable and kind host.  We arrived somewhat late in the evening, and she was there to greet us and immediately give us information about the surrounding area.  We stayed for four nights and had a wonderful time.  <br/><br/>There are plenty of buses close to the flat, and the Hammersmith station (centrally connected) about a 20-30 minute walk away.  The area is a bit quieter than I had expected, with most places closing down by 11pm during the week, but it is very safe, clean, and convenient.  <br/><br/>I would 100% recommend staying here!"
934366,15745518,2014-07-15,12160846,Ольга,"Very cozy Studio apartment with all necessary. The accommodation was perfect for our trip.

Just close to the house there are plenty of good places to eat and good connections to reach the tourist attractions of London. In the studio it is possible to cook and store things in the fridge and there's a couple of supermarkets just around the corner.<br/>Sylvan is a great host! She was very kind to give information about the area and public transport and was always very rapid in writing back on airbnb. We are especially grateful for her great flexibility with regards to check out/in times. We'll definitely consider going back to Sylvan's for our next trip to London!<br/>

934366,71940389,2016-04-30,32925349,Janna,This cozy and lovely apartment is not as close to the center as we wish for but there's 24/7 transport to any place you want. Sylvan was very nice to us. Always available to all our needs and questions. The room is super clean and lightened.
934366,74052374,2016-05-12,52615200,Karen,"Sylvan was very welcoming, helpful and friendly. The beautiful house is easily located, in a quiet residential area, though close to public transport links and restaurants. The room was spacious, comfortable and well designed. Definitely would recommend this one."
934366,74798632,2016-05-16,54724562,Ines,"I am very happy with my choice of staying at Sylvan's place: I booked for two weekends in a row; clean and neat was my room each time and so comfortable that it felt like home. Sylvan is a very welcoming and accomodating host. I particularly appreciated her help when I was running late and she spontaneously offered to drive me to the nearest bus station in order for me to catch the bus for the airport. The house is located in Fulham which is a very charming and calm neighbourhood; offering several authentique coffee places and restaurants and is well served by public transit.<br/>I highly recommend sylvan's accomodation, both the studio and the double bedroom. "
934366,76667275,2016-05-28,47649931,Philipp,"Staying at Sylvan's was a very positive experience. Easy to find, welcoming, clean, well equipped."
934366,78189186,2016-06-05,27777443,John,"Sylvan was very welcoming and accommodating. We kept in touch with her via Airbnb leading up to our arrival due to missing a flight connection. We ended up arriving a day late but it was no problem and everything went smoothly. Getting to the house from Heathrow was straightforward: underground and then bus.<br/><br/>The unit was great for 2 people: kitchenette, table, couch, bed, tv, closet space, and private bathroom. The unit is on the top floor, so the bathroom has a sloped ceiling. The only reason this is worth mentioning is because if you're a person of some height (I'm 6 feet), you won't be able to stand tall in the shower. This wasn't a problem for me but if you have back or neck issues you may wish to take that into consideration. <br/><br/>We found the best way to get into the city center was walking 10-15 minutes to the ""Fulham Broadway"" underground station and then taking a train.<br/><br/>I also used a nearby laundry service Sylvan recommended. For 12 pounds, I dropped off a full load of dirty laundry and picked it up clean, dry and folded later that day."
934366,79022763,2016-06-10,64341944,Melanie Rose,"I had a wonderful time at my first Airbnb experienced at Sylvans house in the loft room. The space was perfect: a studio on the top floor with kitchen, couch, table, large bed, closet, and bathroom. I loved the cozy feel and the sky windows and porch door were lovely. Sylvan greated me upon my arrival and even though the hour was late, stayed to help me settle in and gave me advice on the attractions to see and best way of getting around. The buses were very close by, came often, got me everywhere I needed in every direction, and easy to hop on and off. The tube station was a 5 minute bus or 15 minute walk, and the location was easy to get to from Heathrow. Sylvan checked in with me daily and made sure I had everything I needed. I enjoyed meeting her sweet soon-to-have-kittens cat too! I highly recommend staying at this Airbnb and will definitely stay again on my return to London. "
934366,80158324,2016-06-16,530764,Megan,"Sylvan's top-floor flat is cute and well-appointed. It's in an upmarket and very safe part of London with lots of nice shops, groceries, and restaurants nearby. Sylvan herself is nice, quick to respond to questions, and very considerate. Highly recommend."
934366,84365058,2016-07-06,59859055,Benoit,"Studio agréable et accueil très chaleureux. Sylvan est très sympathique et disponible pour répondre à nos questions. <br/>Attention néanmoins à une petite chose : la hauteur de plafond dans la douche est assez basse et les personnes de grandes tailles, comme moi, ne peuvent pas prendre la douche debout ! C'est un détail par rapport au confort du logement. "
934366,85230229,2016-07-10,21903482,Thibault,"Great host, helpful, and talkative! The room is very comfortable. No problem during our stay. Thank you Sylvan!"
934366,85661356,2016-07-12,41188646,Alison,"Sylvan was the perfect host, all questions answered promptly, made us feel very welcome without intruding on our privacy.  The Flat is just as shown on the pictures, has all you would need, Sylvan even left toiletries for us to use.  It is very close to transport and in a very quiet part of London.  Wifi provided for free and has excellent connection.  Would thoroughly recommend this flat, and hope to return for any other London trips we make.  Thank you so much Sylvan."
934366,87297379,2016-07-19,13539860,Martin,"Sylvan place is great! She is very nice, kind and ""ready to help"" person. Place is better then described, perfect for couples. Warm and cozy. It is just 10-15 min walk from the Fulham Broadway station. You get all the amenities needed. Definitely would come back. "
934366,88911811,2016-07-26,27975123,Dorte,"<br/>I would highly recommend this lovely and quiet house in Fulham. It is exactly as described, easy to find and well equipped. Sylvan is a lovely host. I really enjoyed my stay here. Thank you so much Sylvan!<br/>"

934366,92682882,2016-08-09,57869740,Abby,"Sylvan was a fantastic host! My husband and I went for a quick 3 day trip and this apartment was perfect. The room was displayed accurately from the pictures and very clean and tidy. Great quiet location (only 20-30 min on the bus to get to ""central London"") with several bus/tube stops nearby. Quick to reply back to messages and very knowledgeable and helpful with activities and attractions there in London. <br/><br/>Strongly suggest staying here and booking with Sylvan! "
934366,94590949,2016-08-16,45397710,Natalia,"Upon arrival, Sylvan warmly welcomed us. She offered us tea, and we carried our bags up two full flights of narrow stairs, which we weren't expecting, as the apartment is on the third floor of the house. As Americans, we weren't expecting the way the shower was set up. The shower only has a half curtain, and we were worried that we would get the entire bathroom wet. The way the skylight is situated near the shower, having no curtain, it felt as though everyone outside could see in. Though we felt we were staying in a very safe neighborhood, the closest tube stop was a 15 minute walk away. This was a rather uncomfortable walk with luggage, but otherwise it was fine. Sylvan was very easy to get into contact with, and she was very flexible with our check in and check out times. Overall we had a very positive experience staying here and we would stay here again. "
934366,96345353,2016-08-22,13848359,Pavel,"I stayed in Sylvan's place over a weekend and I liked the place really well. The apartment is on the top floor, it's cozy and would work best for a single person or a couple who like to be close :). Sylvan provides all the amenities, there's all you need for cooking and eating as well, and Sylvan is really nice and helpful and eager to make you feel comfortable. <br/>The bathroom has a full-size bathtub and the hot water was good. The main bed was a bit too soft for me, but that's personal of course. <br/>The best way to get to the place with the public transportation is to take the Tube to the Fulham Broadway station (District, the green line, Wimbledon direction from the city center) and then it's a 15-mins walk or bus 211 or 295 (stop: Sherbrooke Road). There are plenty of lovely dining options around, as well as supermarkets, the neighborhood is residential and so it felt nice, tidy and safe.  <br/><br/>My only note to someone who might have a light sleep like me: there are planes landing and taking off from Heathrow--those are quite audible, but they stop at night. <br/><br/>All in all I can definitely recommend Sylvan's place."
934366,98388012,2016-08-30,68879054,Patrizia,The studio is very nice. It is convenient and close to bus stops and metro. There  are markets. Sylvan is very helpful and nice. I hope to be able to return here. I recommend it.

934366,104759669,2016-09-28,73806885,Dana,"Sylvan was a great host! She answered all our questions prior to booking to ensure the place was right for us. She met us at the flat and gave us a run down of the area with directions to the nearest grocery store, laundry, and the local pub!! She helped orientate us about busses and transit so is was easy to get around and find our way! Thanks Sylvan!! "

934366,107711949,2016-10-11,29799329,Debra,"Sylvan's place is small, clean and cozy. Close to the bus stop that takes you to Westminster Bridge in about 30 minutes or so. The neighborhood is safe and has everything you need within a very easy walking distance. It's a little further out than I expected so transit time is longer and taxi's and Uber can get costly, but I had a great time in London and Sylvan was a great in helping me get arohndcwith maps and instructions."
934366,107984063,2016-10-13,69025474,Jake,"Sylvan's place was just like in the photos - clean and cosy. The wifi and hot water worked well, and the bed was comfy. The apartment is close to public transport, and no further than half an hour from the main sights of London. Baileys fish n chips, the captain cook pub on the corner, and the couple of cafes near Hammersmith station are all worth a look. Thanks Sylvan for a great stay."
934366,108516766,2016-10-16,14551588,Flora,A very lovey cosy studio! The place was exactly as shown in the photos. Host was very accommodating and very friendly. Highly recommend for others ! 
934366,110139723,2016-10-24,46894876,Amy,"Didn't see Sylvan until the morning we left, but communication running up to and during the stay was great.  Room is lovely and cosy and has everything you need. Was a 10-15 minute walk to train and found it a great base to explore London from. Will definitely stay again if I'm ever there again! "
934366,111143385,2016-10-30,95728633,Amandine,Sylvan has been very welcoming.
934366,112146918,2016-11-04,2726777,Dasha,Sylvan was very warm and welcoming upon our arrival at the apartment. The check in went very smoothly and the apartment was very cute and cozy. We were out exploring the city all three days of our stay but in the mornings there was plenty of light and just enough space to get ready and have coffee. We really enjoyed the neighbourhood as well. 
934366,113332315,2016-11-12,99967984,David,"The studio is very nice and comfortable, its in an excellent quiet location with easy access to central parts of London. Sylvan is a very good and helpful host."
934366,114406890,2016-11-18,48340017,Penny,"Sylvan is a warm and friendly host and always responded promptly to my queries and gave good advice. The studio is exactly as described and is well equipped. I liked the neighbourhood & there are many little shops and restaurants nearby. (There is a Tesco Express and a Coop at either end of the Rosaline Road which are open until about 11pm) The nearest tube is Parsons Green, which is about 15min walk. This is a bit far if you have luggage, but Uber's are quick, convenient at anytime of day and cost about £5. Would definitely recommended this place to others!"
934366,114823681,2016-11-20,21836219,Mattia,"The place was really nice and cosy. We felt as if it were our house. We didn't stay much but it's extremely well equipped. The area is also conveniently close to public transportation and the flat can be reached easily.<br/>Also, Sylvan was a wonderful guest, helpful and kind. She stayed up late to welcome us when our flight got severely delayed and she helped us a lot also on our departure day. Very recommended!"
934366,117151634,2016-12-05,5280913,Ben,"Sylvan was a great host, kind and a good conversationalist, and the spot is super quiet. Unfortunately the room was too small for two male friends to share and the short ceilings, esp in the shower and toilet, were super uncomfortable for these 6-foot-plus guests. The spare bed for the guest is very small and really only workable for a child or small person, unfortunately, and the neighbourhood felt far away from most thins we were doing. The cats were cute but we were both allergic and sadly couldn't pet them! So in all, not saying this is a bad place; it just wasn't right for two adult friends staying together. "
934366,121344589,2016-12-16,37206042,Paloma,"Great place to stay! Sylvan makes such a great host. This studio offers everything you would ask, one of the safest communities in London, very convenient public transportation, tidy rooms and cute cats. Definitely want a second stay. "
934366,123648225,2016-12-30,103508149,Peter,"The studio was as lovely as advertised.  It was perfect for a couple seeking a quiet and romantic place to stay.  Sylvan was very helpful and easy to communicate with, the ideal host!  Getting around was very easy as it was right down the street from a bus that drops you off at an Underground hub.  The only minor concern was the shower did not have a lot of head room, but that is easily remedied by the ability to take a bath!  All in all this is an excellent place to stay in London and I would certainly recommend it others."
934366,125334549,2017-01-05,11292053,Daryl,Nice and cosy apartment in a quiet Neighbourhood ! Sylvan is really friendly and easy to communicate ! Thank you once again for hosting us ! 
934366,130912258,2017-02-09,72348549,Craig,"Sylvan was a great host, always willing to help. She went out of her way to accommodate any requests and made me feel comfortable and at home. The Studio has everything you need and is very centrally located, with easy access to Fulham broadway, Parsons Green and Barons Court. Would definitely stay here again."
934366,132001826,2017-02-15,27110653,Duncan,Lovely place to stay with good access to local surroundings. If I'm in the local area again I will certainly stay here again and would recommend.
934366,145465428,2017-04-18,26649371,Jackie,Sylvan was a kind host who provided useful information about how to get around or where to find a good cafe.<br/>The room was comfortable and homely and I felt very safe and comfortable as a female solo traveller as house is in a quiet area.I think the room suits a single or couple fine and is so close to regular transport.Great to have cooking facilities and a fridge.<br/>Be patient with the shower as it takes a little while to get a good temperature but no issue.A quiet place after busy days in London.<br/>
934366,151355316,2017-05-12,128558267,Bruce,"Great room, nice and quiet, lovely host, just mind your head in the shower! :-)"
934366,154532337,2017-05-25,39654017,Lisa,"I loved this studio! Light, airy, private and clean with excellent public transport links.  Bus stops are a very short walk from the house which will take you to 2 underground stations within a few minutes.  I especially enjoyed morning greetings from Sylvan's beautiful and friendly cats. Having a fridge, kettle and microwave was extremely helpful.  I recommend this studio (and her other rooms) to travelers who prefer private homestays over hotel accommodations and I hope to book here again for my future visits.  Thanks Sylvan!"
934366,156849628,2017-06-01,12299569,Denise,"Sylvan was brilliant host, she is also a very pleasant person.<br/>The studio is bright, comfortable, cosy and equipped with all amenities usefull during the stay.  There is a high quality mattress as well as fluffy down extra duvet. Only minutes away from buses and 15 minutes walk to Fulham Broadway Tube Station. Lovely restaurants, Cafés, shops situated next to Sylvan's house. I highly recommend Sylvan's house to anyone who wants to stay in London."

There are several choices of public transport (buses and trains) in the area which can take you in all directions. Also there is a variety of restaurants and pubs close by but if you prefer the studio has cooking facilities. The ensuite bathroom is a bonus."

934366,284375583,2018-07-01,24211706,Lorna,The studio is a great self-contained space. Quiet with lovely french doors to let in the light. Well situated in West London in a residential area but not too far a walk to restuarants or the tube. I'd recommend it.

Après une journée trépidante dans le cœur de Londres, ça fait du bien de rentrer dans un lieu tranquille.<br/>C'est bien desservi par plusieurs bus, le centre de Londres est rapidement accessible. Le métro est un peu plus loin (12 - 15 mn à pied)<br/>Sylvan est une personne très gentille, qui cherche vraiment à faire plaisir à ses invités.

934366,362807829,2018-12-27,3498559,Anirudh,"Comfortable place in SW London. 3-4 minutes' walk from the bus stop, 4 stops by bus to the nearest Underground station.<br/><br/>The studio was spotlessly clean, and cosy and comfortable. The private bathroom is the clincher, since not many Airbnb hosts in London offer that. Add to it the kitchenette, basic cooking materials, TV, refrigerator, and so on, and you have a super home base in London.<br/><br/>Sylvan is an immaculate host - polite, charmingly British, and gives you all the privacy you need. Fully recommend her and the place!"

The room is well-equipped with a bed, sofabed, table (workspace next to the window), iron, hair dryer, hoover etc. The area is quite quiet. The room is pretty stylish and the bathroom is comfortable to use. It wasn't difficult to get from the airport to her home by Tube and bus, even with heavy luggage. Took me about 1.5h or so to her doorstep. Sylvan is really friendly and accommodating, and her cats were so friendly. I've got no complaints at all, I would definitely stay here again."
934366,415300638,2019-02-22,12299569,Denise,"This was the third time that I stayed at Sylvan’s house. Wonderful cosy place, very comfortable bed,  nothing is missing. Sylvan is a great and very pleasant person. Tube station is at only 15 minutes walk, buses are even closer."

934366,447903002,2019-05-04,202342062,John,Our first Airbnb stay was for four nights here. Sylvan is hospitable and room was spacious including kitchenette and en-suite bathroom. It felt like a retreat in the city.<br/>Little touches of the books are nice plus we get to meet two new fab Friends  
934366,450739882,2019-05-10,7618544,Kate,"Sylvan is a fascinating person, and this is clear from her delightfully eclectic house. The walls have many stories to tell. The loft studio perches you amongst the roof tops, and it was a delight being able to watch the scudding clouds & enjoy the birds eye perspective of this neighbourhood as you drink your morning tea. Charming and quirky, this place was a treat that will stay in my mind for a long time."

The skylights make it a light and airy space, and the location is terrific.  Sylvan is very informative and helpful and I would not hesitate to return."
934366,468361218,2019-06-12,11061485,Isabella,This was my seventh time at Sylvan's. It is my home from home. I enjoy every minute especially when Piglet and Popet come to visit me. Thanks Sylvan. See you in September.
934366,470508689,2019-06-16,77930557,Brigitt,Excelente lugar para hospedarse por la confianza y seguridad que transmite. Toda la descripción es tal cual.

934366,504856984,2019-08-08,1286075,Christine,We had a very pleasant stay at Sylvan's house which is in a beautiful residential area. There's a supermarket just around the corner and it's fairly easy to go to central London. The room was really cozy and we felt very much at home. It was super clean and well equipped. Sylvan was a very friendly host. She gave superb advice for going around London. We really enjoyed staying with her and highly recommend the place.
934366,512340847,2019-08-18,265028253,Claudia,Silvan is more generous. Her house is very comfortable and clean. Has three cats wonderful!
934366,517139480,2019-08-25,212994635,Owen,Fantastic place to stay and I have not found a better host than Sylvan yet. Cannot recommend high enough!
934366,521061570,2019-08-31,37525411,Faith,Each time I come to London I prefer staying at Sylvan’s safe and warm house. I will come back again for sure.
934366,525172177,2019-09-07,43980920,Peter,"Sylvan’s apartment is a perfect base for exploring London.  It is well serviced by public transport - the bus is only a short walk away and this will take you to a number of tube stations or, if you prefer, it will take you right in to central London.  There is also a wide range of restaurants and shops in the area.  Sylvan is a very gracious and welcoming host and her apartment is very comfortable.  I would have no hesitation in recommending Sylvan’s apartment as a great place to stay!"
934366,528114208,2019-09-12,40972151,Lynnette,"We enjoyed our stay here.   The property is well situated to public transportation and the surrounding neighborhood is quiet and contains many good restaurants, coffee shops and pubs.   Sylvan is an accommodating host and was very helpful in sharing information about Fulham and London.   We enjoyed our few days in this comfortable, clean apartment and would recommend it to others."
934366,530077380,2019-09-15,11061485,Isabella,Another great stay at Sylvan's. Can't wait to come back.
934366,543237003,2019-10-07,292314879,Suvi,"Sylvan is a very kind person, and seems happy to have you there! <br/><br/>Upon our arrival, we had to wait outside in the cold for almost an hour at 11pm-midnight before getting in to the flat. We were not able to get hold of Sylvan and it got to the point that we called air bnb customer service, as we thought we might have to look for alternative place to stay at midnight!<br/><br/>Finally Sylvan got back to me after several missed calls and a message, and she greeted us warmly! I had informed that there would be two guests, but she hadn’t prepared for two (only one towel). We didn’t mind this, but it’s the small details really that make the difference. <br/><br/>Also one thing to bare in mind is that the shower ceiling is very low, me being 179cm was not able to stand up right in the shower. I’m sure you would be able to use the shared downstairs shower if you are tall and find it difficult to shower upstairs, but that means you won’t have your own bathroom, as mentioned in the room description. <br/><br/>On our check our date, we found out that she had travelled abroad for few days during our visit. We would have liked to be notified of this in case of any emergencies. <br/><br/>The studio itself is nice and spacious and has all the amenities one needs, and even has Netflix which is great for lazy evenings in! The bed and duvet are comfortable and there is a radiator right next to the bed, which I’m sure is nice for colder months! If you are a light sleeper, I would bare in mind that all the air plains arriving to Heathrow fly over Fulham Broadway, so you do get noise from that.<br/><br/>The location itself is great, several busses going near by. Fulham Broadway station with great amenities is a 7-10min walk away. Do note that district line (the tube running from Fulham Broadway) has planned closures almost every weekend, such as the weekend we stayed there! But we like taking the bus, so we enjoyed the bus rides!<br/><br/>We hope you a pleasant stay at Sylvans!"
934366,548242421,2019-10-17,99132687,Isobel,"This is a fabulous Airbnb which I recommend 110%. Beautiful house, lovely host, Sylvan, gives a lovely welcome, shows you the accommodation then leaves you in peace...the perfect host. Accommodation is as described in the ad and the photo. But descriptions don’t fully convey the calm atmosphere, comfort and good vibe this apartment offers. Top stars in every respect. Be aware the room is on the 2nd floor so a few stairs but lovely space to relax when you get there . <br/>Location is great. Just off the 211 bus route (3 mins away) which gives great central city access to say the least. Or a 15 min brisk walk to Fulham Broadway tube.<br/>Also very reasonably priced for this fabulous self-contained accommodation.<br/>Loved it. Thank you Sylvan. I will definitely return"
934366,554471987,2019-10-26,30453365,Steven,A beautiful place!

We are Brazilian, living in Miami and  I was very worried about Nicole going to London by herself. Sylvan was such a great host and very helpful. My daughter felt very welcoming and safe.

We are now having a hard time finding such and cute place with a wonderful host like Sylvia. Thank you!!"

It’s about a 15 min walk from every tube station, so prepare to get your steps in if you want to go into central London. But there are plenty of grocery stores, pubs, coffee shops, and restaurants within just a few blocks. Great location for the price, and Sylvan is so sweet and is super communicative."
934366,500543334657914744,2021-11-21,157961699,Crystal,"We had such a pleasant 3-day stay, it is located in a quiet residential area, within walking distance to the tube station and bus stops, there are supermarkets, restaurants and shops nearby as well. <br/><br/>The loft-conversion room is very cosy, beautifully furnished with basic amenities and cookware provided. The TV has Youtube and Netflix, which is conveniently placed across the comfy bed for a nice lazy day. What I loved most was the amount of daylight we got from the skylights, it was a huge plus for me!<br/><br/>Sylvan was quick to respond to my messages and was lovely to speak to. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"
1486702,6522098,2013-08-15,5457247,Claire,"If this room is available, there is not one reason why you shouldn't book it! <br/>Our experience when we stayed with Paulo was by far the best Airbnb experience that we have had.  As a host, Paulo could not be more accommodating.  He made us feel comfortable in his apartment from the moment we walked in and did everything he could to make our experience excellent.  Breakfast was set out every morning for us and we even had the privilege of trying Paulo's AMAZING cooking skills.  <br/>The house is always tidy and filled with natural light and the room and bed is very comfortable. Location wise, you couldn't get much better with everything you need (night life, cafe's and grocery store) a 1 minute walk from the front door. <br/>My partner and I believe we have made a friend for life! Thank you Paulo, we can't wait to come back :)"

1486702,8698710,2013-11-12,9420945,Mathieu,"My girl friend and me stayed 2 nights at Paulo's place.<br/>It was our first airbnb expérience.

Thank´s again Paulo, next time will be longer :)"

And to have nice talks with him about everything, giving us good advices about places to visit, to eat, etc. His flat is very tidy and clean with a wide and very lightly room. It's in a very good place and very well connected. Paulo takes good care of making you feel as you were at home. We would really like to get in touch with him and repeat the experience. We recomend indeed to go to his place if you think going to London.<br/>November 2013"

His appartment is just lovely, ideal for a couple or a single person. He knows so many places and things to do in London that he composed a recommendation schedule for our days with my partner in London. The area is really so convenient with all the shops and restaurants you can visit and also close to the city center.<br/>I really think is the best value-for-money apartment we could stay. "
1486702,10014289,2014-01-25,2445144,Eliza,"My stay at Paulo's was all that I could have wanted! He anticipated every need and the flat was immaculate. It was very conveniently located, and really comfortable. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a great place to stay in London!! "

1486702,12974430,2014-05-16,13170266,Michele,"First of all, I would like to say that Paulo's place and hospitality more than exceeded our expectations! As first tjmers in air bnb, my husband and I wanted to stay in a place where we can be comfortable and relaxed. Paulo's friendliness and the way he goes out of his way to treat us like we've been friends for a long time was very much appreciated and we couldn't ask for a better person to host us in our stay in London. Paulo's tagline as the ""best in clapham"" is most definitely true. :)"
1486702,13138577,2014-05-20,1991466,Roberto,"Paulo is a great and respectful host and did his best to make our 2nd experience in London the best. Available and always willing to and ready to help us anytime we needed. The small apt. is cosy, tidy, clean and warm. No problems, no annoyances, we felt at home but obviously respecting his home and him. Vey easy access to whatever one may need. Underground, buses, taxis, Sainsbury market with a passage in the outside area one minute from the apt. Great Clapham Common area facilities at hand! The ad pics description are real. Good breakfast provided.<br/>Definitely I would recommend him to my best friend or relative.<br/>Thank you again, Paulo. God bless you in all His ways!"
1486702,13415676,2014-05-27,35548,Anh,"The flat lives up to the pictures and your host, Paulo, lives up to the ideals that make Airbnb a great experience. The location is a reasonable distance to the city center for the sights and a short walk from the nearest tube station. Plenty of places to walk around nearby for bar hopping or dinner. The flat had no unwanted surprises. He greeted us proper, gave us the legitimate flat tour and added touches that make you feel you truly are at a BnB. If you're easy going and communicative, you should feel like you're staying with a great friend and comfortable to come and go as you please. We couldn't imagine enjoying London as much without Paulo as our host and new found friend. Cannot recommend enough and during your stay, ask for the ""Happy Pharrell"" suite package, which is really just Paulo being as cheerful as that song can be! Great memories, thanks Paulo!"
1486702,14161647,2014-06-13,14398675,Belinda,"My second experience with airbnb was great. The room and the house is just the same as the pictures, nice, clean, tidy and new. The house is really warm, feel home, ""Mi casa es tu casa"" as Paulo always say. <br/>I booked for 3 nights and the whole stay was great, I just moved to London, looking for flats, jobs and everything, I really appreciate the fact that he came to pick me up at the station (I was carrying a backpack, a bag and 2 huge suitcases), prepared the lunch, was starving by the time I got home. <br/>Thankyou again Paulo for the advices, help provided! <br/><br/>Hopefully I'll get a nice place and job to stay in London. See you soon when things are settle down. <br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Belinda and Luke<br/><br/>xxxxxx"

1486702,14738776,2014-06-25,7309371,Cristiane,"Telling about the experience of staying in Paulo's flat could be repetitive or very similar of the other reviews he had received before. They are all the truth! He's a very responsable and respectfull person. Attentive and worried if we were or not having fun in London; if we were safe and feeling comfortable in his comfy, tidy and clean apartment. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe, despite it is nearby all the conveniences that a traveller in holidays needs. <br/>In our case, there were one more thing: a friendship, a affinity as if we were friends of a long time. A happiness in the air all the time we were there. And now a sadness of letting our new friend in London."
1486702,15092497,2014-07-02,758413,Sywert,"We had a really nice time at Paulo's. Paulo is a very friendly and warm person with a big interest in others. His appartment is clean and tidy. The bedroom was very nice as well, just as in the pictures. Paulo is great to chat with. He provided us with loads of tips and we also had other nice conversations. His appartment is a 3 minute walk from Clapham Common tube station; only a 10/15 minute ride to the city centre. We would highly recommend Paulo and love to meet him again sometime"
1486702,15557915,2014-07-11,2652493,Sanda,"I't was a great staying at Paulo's Flat. First the communication from the first messages was totally perfect and our Host our host was particularly welcoming. They gave us all the details of the apartment and was to listen to our requests. <br/>The room itself is perfect, very clean, lots of storage, wardrobe and chest of drawers; bedside lamp and also a small HIFI. The bedding is very comfortable, it was a long time I did not sleep as well. There are also toilets for hotel guests only. In addition, the environment is very quiet in a safe neighborhood. <br/>All transportation is available within 5 minutes walk, tube and many buses. <br/>Thank you to Paulo, for having so advised us and inviting us to dinner for our last night. The meal was prepared by himself; I also do not forget breakfast kit prepared every morning. <br/>There is really much to say about the quality of service Paulo and I well recommend to the entire community. It is certain that I will return home with great pleasure. <br/>Thank you again for everything! <br/>Sanda"

He was always willing to help us, in order to have a great journey. <br/><br/>We spent three nights at Paulo's flat, which was a good place. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, etc. So everything was okay. The neighborhood was also great to stay; the tube is available within 5 minutes walk. And there are also good restaurants, bars and supermarkets. Within 15 minutes, you're in the center of London. <br/><br/>If we visit London again, we will surely stay at his flat again.

Questa é stata per noi la prima esperienza e si é rivelata una scelta azzeccata!<br/>La casa é favolosa, pulita e in una posizione ottima per prendere la metro. La zona é sicura e molto popolata, inoltre c'è un ampia scelta di locali  per poter uscire la sera, senza dover prendere i mezzi di trasporto. <br/>Paulo é una persona fantastica! Ospitale, disponibile e gioiosa. È stato molto d'aiuto nella scelta dei migliori luoghi da visitare e posti da frequentare.

As first-time airbnb users, we were a bit nervous on what to expect, but he gave us the warmest welcome ever (even when we arrived a bit late!) having a little chat while dining. He's an ace cooker! <br/><br/>We spent an amazing stay at his place, he was always willing to give us suggestions to visit amazing places off the beaten track in London, helping us to get there and asking if we were doing ok! He really take care of his guests... At least we feel it that way! <br/><br/>And what to say about the room... Lovely and cozy! A place where you really can relax after a long day walking the city (and I have to say it... one of the comfiest beds we've ever slept being on holidays!).<br/><br/>We are looking forward to do another London trip, and with no doubt we'll ask him to be our host!

He knows ""the London life"" pretty well. Excellent chef by the way!<br/>The flat is amazing, very tidy and clean. We had everything we need (ultra-close Sainsbury´s)  and the location is perfect (a few meters from the tube and the bus stops). Clapham is a real nice place to live or to visit this beautiful city.<br/>We totally recommend Paulo´s flat. A truly home away from home.<br/>Thank you for your help Paulo!!!"

It really made us feel comfortable.<br/><br/>By the way, we like your kitchen very much as it is neat, clean, and fully equipped. We, especially my wife, were impressed with you being able  keep the bathroom and kitchen clean all the time.<br/><br/>We also like the location of your apartment. It is in a quiet neighbourhood, only about 10 mins walk to the nearest tube station, and it has several supermarkets there as well.<br/><br/>We would definitely recommend those want to visit London to stay at your place anytime.<br/><br/>Regards<br/>KengEt Yeo & TG Teo"
1486702,35787746,2015-06-22,30933677,Denis,"Paulo made our welcome and our stay with him ""so"" good. Being our first time using Airbnb we were a little unsure how things would work but we give Paulo 10 out of 10 and would certainly stay with him again."
1486702,36502686,2015-06-29,19813431,Nicole,Paulo was so accommodating and made us feel so welcome in his home. He explained everything thoroughly and our only regret is that we didn't get much time with him. We are returning in a fortnight and will enjoy spending some time with Paulo then. 
1486702,37160450,2015-07-05,7081546,Caroline,"Paulo was very welcoming, kind, good company and his flat was exactly as described in the advert. It smelt really lovely too! I would definitely stay with him again."

1486702,37850353,2015-07-11,2570831,Bianca,"Paulo's apartment was clean, tidy and had a beautiful fragrance. The bedroom was beautifully welcoming with clean linen and towels and anything you would want in a bedroom for your stay. <br/>I booked this place for my grandparents and they absolutely loved it given Paulo could speak Italian and helped them with anything they needed.<br/><br/>Paulo's apartment is very well located in Clapham behind the big sainsburys and walk into Clapham high street through sainsburys is only 10mins or earlier depending how slow or fast you walk!<br/><br/>Perfect apartment and highly recommend to anyone staying in the Clapham region or want to be close to the city main hub but then having some breathing space.<br/><br/>"
1486702,38587832,2015-07-17,19813431,Nicole,This was our second time staying with Paulo and we would stay again in a heartbeat. He was so kind and welcoming and it felt like we were staying with a friend. I cannot recommend Paulo and his gorgeous flat enough!

He is very nice, friendly and respectul.<br/>He gave us some good advice for our holiday.<br/>About the room everything was perfect. The room was clean and well equipped. Some clean towels were waiting us on the comfortable double bed. The bathroom and toilet were as well very clean (like all his apartment).<br/>Paulo won his stars on Air BNB!<br/>It was our first experience on Air BNB and it was a great success!<br/>Thank's Paulo."
1486702,41214372,2015-08-05,15281313,Mike,The flat was brilliant. Close to local coffee shops and restaurants. Easy access to the tube and the rest of London. Paulo was very friendly and always available to answer questions or give advice on all things London. The flat was comfortable and spacious.
1486702,41738202,2015-08-09,24796405,Cassandra,Paulo was the perfect host! He answered all of our questions before we came and was nothing but helpful once we have arrived. We loved staying at his flat! There is plenty of room to move around and relax of you want to. We always felt like we could come and go as we pleased with out disturbing him. Even when we had to leave at 4:30 in the morning to chat our train. Paulo is very nice and always willing to chat of you need advice or have any questions. Overall we had an amazing time in london!!! We cannot wait to go back!
1486702,42597006,2015-08-14,2823398,Angeles Del Pilar,"Paulo es realmente un excelente host! Desde que comenzamos la reserva hasta después de irnos nos ayudo con tips. Su casa es realmente como aparece en las fotografías, la ubicación es perfecta tanto para tomar metro o bus que es mas barato ( 5 min a pie ) . Hay lugares muy ricos y baratos para comer cerca. Nargulli, heladería exquisita y unos pubs bien buenos en el Old Town de Clapham. Gracias nuevamente por todo ! "
1486702,44513767,2015-08-27,4836809,Marea,"This was a wonderful Airbnb experience for us. Paolo's flat is a short walk from Clapham Common station, The Common itself and lots of bars and restaurants plus a couple of supermarkets. Being on The Northern Line, it is really easy to get into Central London. Paolo was a most welcoming host. He really made us feel that his home was also our home during our 12 day stay. The accommodation was exactly as described and was of a very high standard. For us, it was really great to be able to unpack our luggage into a chest of drawers and wardrobe instead of living out of a suitcase. Paolo knows and loves London and was more than happy to share his very extensive knowledge with us. We enjoyed our chats with Paolo over a glass of red on several evenings during our stay. We would highly recommend a stay with Paolo and we hope to return ourselves at some stage in the future."
1486702,46859304,2015-09-14,29666614,Ute Und Andreas,"Paulo was a very attentive, friendly host. Thanks to his tips we discovered great places in London. His Flat was very clean and stylish. Our room was cozy and we had plenty of room for our stuff."

1486702,50090753,2015-10-09,2071472,Pedro,"My girlfriend and I had a terrific time at Paulo's place. It was very well located, close to the underground and in a nice area full of tasty restaurants and bars, near a nice park. We've really enjoyed Clapham.<br/>The apartment was perfect: clean, comfy, modern, we felt at home! We could use the kitchen for our occasional meals, the bathroom was very clean and the shower is great (nice hot water :), and the bed in the room is incredibly comfy.<br/><br/>Paulo was such a friendly host, he made everything he could to make sure we had a great stay, he was available for all our questions (even via (Hidden by Airbnb) ) and (really) likes to get to know his hosts. I would definitely recommend this place."
1486702,51937702,2015-10-25,42322530,Yeo,"Paulo was a really friendly and organised host. Everything you needed was contained in a nice envelope. Am glad we took his advice and took the bus to town. He also suggested we visit the brixton market on the weekend which was a wonderful idea. <br/><br/>Paulo's house was nice and clean, and a simple breakfast was provided everyday. A pity that we didnt have much chance to chat, but will certainly stay at his place again should we visit london!"
1486702,52955891,2015-11-03,31635384,Karen,"Fantastic in every way!! Paulo was an excellent host, friendly, welcoming, informative and knowledgeable, and has a great sense of humour. Paulo's flat is very nicely appointed and comfortable and impeccably kept, and was an absolute pleasure to stay in. The location is great too, only a 5 min walk to buses, tube, shops and coffee! Our only regret is that our paths didn't cross more often whilst we were there so we could get to know Paulo a bit more. Definitely an experience to be repeated. Thank you, Paulo, for making our holiday stay with you so pleasant and memorable!"
1486702,53465938,2015-11-09,6304929,Claudia,"Bei Paulo zu Gast zu sein war eine besondere Erfahrung. Er ist ein sehr fürsorglicher, umsichtiger und an dir interessierter Gastgeber. Es ist als ob man einen guten Freund besucht, einen Freund der Airbnb Gemeinschaft. Seine Wohnung ist schön und modern eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Uns hat nichts gefehlt. Clapham hat eine sehr lebendige Hauptstraße auf der man alles bekommt, was man braucht. Aber auch in Paulos Küche kann man kochen, wenn man das möchte. Ich kann einen Besuch bei Paulo nur empfehlen. Thank you for everything, Paulo!!! We enjoyed to stay with you."
1486702,54573717,2015-11-22,7907234,Elisabetta,"It was our second time in London at Paulo's place!<br/>The best host absolutely!!!<br/>The flat was very clean,tidy,comfortable and lovely!!<br/>The bed and bedroom was very comfortable and you have everything you need!<br/>The bathroom was very very clean and fresh!<br/>Clapham Common..we love it!!!<br/>Full of shops,coffee,supermarkets and restaurants!<br/>In less then 5 minutes you can take the tube (Northern Line) and in 10 minutes you are in the center of London!You can also use the buses that connect very well Clapham Common with the center of London also at night.<br/>Paulo..that great man!!!:)<br/>He was very friendly,very polite,available,welcoming and with a great sense of humor!!<br/>We spent with him a terrific time!<br/>We would definitely recommend this place!<br/>Next time in London..we'll come back to Paulo's flat of course!!<br/>Thanks Paulo!<br/>Ely&Andre"
1486702,55919676,2015-12-07,45832759,Francisco Javier,"Nuestra primera experiencia con Airbnb ha sido totalmente satisfactoria.Paulo nos ofreció su casa como si fuesemos viejos amigos suyos, todo lo que tenía lo puso a nuestra entera disposición a la vez que nos proporcionó el respeto y la independencia que necesitamos en todo momento, nos ayudó a elaborar planes para conocer Londres a fondo y nos aconsejó a visitar lugares únicos que sin su ayuda no se nos hubiera ocurrido visitar nunca y que nos hicieron conocer la auténtica esencia de la ciudad.<br/>La vivienda está muy bien comunicada tanto por metro como por diferentes autobuses que te llevan al centro de la ciudad en poco tiempo. Un gran supermercado frente a la vivienda te permite hacer compras para elaborar las comidas que precises y Paulo también te recomienda lugares donde comer en diversas zonas de la ciudad.<br/>Ha sido una buena experiencia , gracias Paulo, hasta siempre."
1486702,71110309,2016-04-23,65227568,Andrea,"Paolo is a wonderful host. He makes you feel at home from the first moment. We enjoyed his place and the neighbourhood it is in. He told us to visit Brixton market, it was fantastic,thanks Paolo. We will be back! "

1486702,76342901,2016-05-26,58599945,Stewart,"Paulo was really great, superb host and really the difference is in the details. Showed us around the house, made sure we really felt at home, even had chocolate waiting for us as a welcome treat. Not to mention all the tips about London, it really helped a lot. Definitely deserves the 5 star rating!"
1486702,77334188,2016-05-31,20978151,Jan,"Paulo is probably the best example of an Air B N B host! <br/>Super Flat, very kind and always reachable. My Family was very happy to stay in his place and would love to stay again ;)!!!"
1486702,80207201,2016-06-16,51574377,Sandra,"Wir haben zum ersten Mal Airbnb benutzt und waren absolut begeistert von Paulo und seiner schönen Wohnung. Er nimmt sich genug Zeit um einem alles zu zeigen und willkommen zu heißen und man fühlt sich gleich wohl bei ihm. Die Wohnung sieht tatsächlich aus wie auf den Bildern und ist sehr ordentlich und sauber (wenn ich das bei meiner nur schaffen würde...). Das Bett ist super bequem und da es 2 Toiletten gibt (ein großes Bad mit WC und Dusche und ein kleines extra WC) gab es auch nie einen ""Stau"". Die Lage ist wirklich exzellent (und angenehm ruhig), da man das Zentrum in Kürze erreichen kann, es aber nicht so stressig zugeht wie auf der Oxford Street. Mit der Tube ist man in rund 15-20 Minuten dort und mit dem Bus 88 hat man auch eine tolle Verbindung (dauert zwar länger, dafür hat man eine schönere Aussicht bei der Fahrt und es ist billiger). Clapham ist einfach eine tolle Gegend mit jeder Menge Bars, Restaurants und Supermärkten. Obwohl wir die Gegend wirklich gut kennen konnte Paulo uns noch ein paar tolle Tipps geben. Er ist immer erreichbar und so hilfsbereit. Wir freuen uns jetzt schon auf ein Wiedersehen :) Thank you Paulo once again and especially for showing us how great Airbnb can be. Until the next time ;) <br/>Sandra & Thomas "
1486702,81435678,2016-06-23,14209866,Cyana,"Paulo was a very friendly host and made us feel welcome immediately. Communication was very easy beforehand. The room was very clean, along with the rest of the apartment. The location was ideal for us -- Clapham is great and Paulo's immediate neighborhood has great restaurants and never felt unsafe. The wifi was also fast and reliable."
1486702,84196898,2016-07-06,54183160,Hilary,"Paulo's apartment was just as pictured. The room was comfortable with plenty of room to put things away. Paulo was a great host-giving us lots of suggestions of things to do and transportation tips. He provided a small selection of coffee, tea, and cereal for breakfast every morning. He was also kind enough to clear a shelf in the refrigerator for any grocery items we bought. Clapham was a great area to be our base in London."
1486702,85732049,2016-07-12,76769884,Nuria,"Nuestra primera experiencia con airbnb no podría haber sido mejor. Desde el primer momento Paulo nos hizo sentirnos como en casa con su carácter amable y acogedor, y nos ayudó a conocer la ciudad atendiendo a nuestros intereses y dándonos valiosos consejos sobre lugares a descubrir, la mejor forma de llegar a ellos e incluso los mejores sitios donde comer o tomar algo. La habitación y la casa en su conjunto son muy acogedoras, todo está limpio y ordenado y tienes a tu disposición lo que puedas necesitar (toallas, menaje, utensilios para cocinar, etc.) El barrio es muy accesible, tanto a través del metro (northern line) como de las diversas líneas de autobús que lo conectan con centros turísticos de interés ( (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) ), una opción interesante para descansar entre paseo y paseo viendo la ciudad o si, como es mi caso, algún problema de salud hace que el metro resulte un poco cansado. El ambiente en la zona es muy agradable y con mucha vida sobre todo los fines de semana, pero el lugar donde está ubicada la casa de Paulo es muy tranquilo y silencioso, perfecto para descansar después de un largo día explorando la ciudad. Hay muchas tiendas en los alrededores (un sainsbury justo al lado), restaurantes y locales de ocio. Puesto que pasábamos todo el día fuera de casa coincidimos poco con Paulo, pero él siempre se mostró a nuestra disposición para cualquier duda o consulta que tuviésemos, respetando en todo momento nuestra privacidad. También tuvo el detalle de cocinar la última noche y compartir así un rato juntos antes de irnos durante la cena. Sin duda alguna nuestra primera visita a Londres no habría sido tan completa y enriquecedora de no haber contado con los consejos de Paulo, por los que estaremos siempre agradecidos y recomendamos la experiencia al 100%."
1486702,87787428,2016-07-21,53370072,John,"Paulo is a wonderfull,friendly host. It's a spacious lovely room and very handy to shops ,pubs and restaurants and public transport. We were sad to leave too."

1486702,95404073,2016-08-19,4836809,Marea,"This was our second longish stay with Paolo and was even better than our first experience. Paolo epitomises what an Airbnb host should be.....friendly, welcoming, helpful with things to do in London. Paolo's home is spotlessly clean and the one thing we really enjoyed was being able to totally unpack into the drawers and wardrobe in our room. The description of what Paolo is offering is very accurate so there will be no nasty little surprises for anyone. We would highly recommend staying with Paolo. We certainly hope to return at some stage in the future."
1486702,101551508,2016-09-13,28587861,James,Paulo was nice and friendly. His place was clean and tidy and very well located. I would stay here again.
1486702,102857404,2016-09-19,89278458,Chuanxin,"This is our first Airbnb experience. It was amazing! Paulo is a very kind friendly host, who likes chatting with us. In addition, his flat is clean and tidy. The first night which we arrived in London, Paulo give us a very detailed plan and guidance to explore London. It is useful. I love all things in London. Thank you for all things, Paulo.<br/><br/>Eric"
1486702,104387406,2016-09-26,89267047,Tanya,"As I made the booking on behalf of someone else, I didn't really stay with Paulo myself. However I know he is an amazing host according to the pre communications we had. He was eager to know the guest and making sure he would enjoy the stay. According to the guest himself, he also really enjoyed the stay and said Paulo was an amazing host. "
1486702,106071248,2016-10-04,14270024,Gaetano  Andrea,"We and Paulo are became friends and we can't imagine our holiday to London without to stay at Paulo's home. The flat is always functional, clean and in order. The position is perfect, it's less of 5 minutes to Tube station and bus station. Clapham Common is good served as well as full of stores (Waitrose, Starbucks, Sainsburys, Boots and others). Paulo's as always kind, thoughtful and gentle. He's a very super host. Thanks Paulo as we say in Italy... ""ti vogliamo bene""! <br/>Andre and Ely.<br/>"
1486702,108496353,2016-10-16,17667265,Caroline,"Highly recommend staying here. Great location (few minutes walk to Clapham Common station), everything you need is close by or easily accessible. <br/>Paulo is super friendly and will make you feel at home. Great value for money. Would definitely stay here again "
1486702,111207237,2016-10-30,17956127,Aroa,"What can I say about Paulo? This is the second time I've been to his place, and I would repeat anytime with no hesitation! He keeps making you feel like you are at home, and helping you to make the most of your visit. This time we spent some time at Clapham Common too, and must say is a neighborhood with a really good & cool vibe. Hope to be back soon! "
1486702,128402974,2017-01-24,39662649,Alejandra,"I really recommend staying here, the apartment is very clean and nice. <br/>Paulo is a great host, very kind, helpful and friendly.<br/>The location is good, very close to the tube station.<br/>Would come back!!"
1486702,169892925,2017-07-14,4836809,Marea,We have stayed with Paulo several times now and each time we have been made feel most welcome. Paulo's home is spotlessly clean and it is a huge plus to be able to unpack into a wardrobe and drawers after having lived out of a suitcase for a while. Paulo's place is a short walk to Clapham common tube station and paulo's passion for life in London is contagious. We would highly recommend a stay here. We will certainly be back.
1486702,174478469,2017-07-26,53370072,John,Very handy to transport and supermarket and restaurants. Nice quiet area.
1486702,177845227,2017-08-04,4836809,Marea,"We have now stayed with Paolo 4 times....and hope to be coming back again.<br/>His hospitality is unsurpassed and he genuinely welcomes you to his home. Fabulous eateries and coffee shops are nearby and Clapham Common tube station is a 4 minute walk away. If you are new to London, Paolo is your man. He has a passion for London that you will find contagious. He has some great recommendations, depending on what you fare looking for. We look forward to our next visit."
1486702,289016139,2018-07-11,53370072,John,"A great location for nearby supermarket, the High Street with lots of dining places, and close to the underground train station."
1486702,292490361,2018-07-18,499551,Elvira,Me and my friend stayed at Pablos apartment for 3 nights. The location is great. Its takes approximately 20 with the tube to any main location in London. The apartment was extremely clean and we felt like home. Even though we didn’t spent a  lot time in the apartment it feels good to find everything clean and towels changed everyday. <br/>Pablo was a great guide and any questions we had he was willing to help us. We highly recommend his place and trust us you wont get disappointed. Cheers !
1486702,297719805,2018-07-28,203134539,Dennis,"Let me start by saying this was my first booking with Air BnB. I was hesitant at first, but after hearing my sister’s experiences I decided to do my research.  Initially I booked our stay with another AirBnB, however after reading Paulo’s previous guest’s reviews, I canceled the other booking and selected Paulo’s. This decision was entirely based on other reviewers and I count on them to be open and honest. Everything they said was spot on. After a few questions back and forth to get to know one another, the booking was confirmed. Communication is so vital when you’re working on a limited vacation. He kept in constant contact and would answer any question I sent within minutes via Whatapp. It was almost like having a personal concierge, literally writing down a recommended itinerary daily for stuff to check out in London. Without a doubt if you’re looking to stay in London for a few days book here. The proximity to the tube system, the experience , and more importantly the company was amazing. I came to London on the first leg of our hunnymoon and we both decided to spend our last night in London over a great meal with Paulo. Thanks Paulo for sharing your space, and I look forward to keeping in touch. "
1486702,334896859,2018-10-10,212825664,Federico,"We spent 4 weeks at Paulo’s and the response is totally positive. Highly recommended. Outstanding cleanliness, service and locations. Paulo, the host, is the bonus. A very nice guy with an extremely positive attitude, he will make your stay as comfortable as it can possibly be. Again, highly recommended."

It’s only 5 mins walk to the tube that takes you anywhere you like. Would recommend his place. Will come back if I get the opportunity again. Thanks Paulo for everything"
1486702,344256545,2018-11-03,13686852,Chiara,"It has been an amazing experience!<br/>Paulo is an excellent host, he's very kind and helpful and gave us a lot of information and tips about where to go, what to do and where to eat.<br/>Even after a working day when he arrived at home he was always smiling and communicative and we talked for hours about travels, politics and other topics...<br/>His home is 5 min by walk from the tube and there are many pubs, restaurants and supermarkets in the nearby.<br/>It is very clean and has everything you may need, starting from breakfast with tea, milk, coffee, biscuits and cereals...<br/>We definetely felt like being at home even if away from home!!!"
1486702,351329525,2018-11-22,178923086,Conchi,"Paulo is a very kind host. He makes you feel as if you were at home. The house is perfect, as it is shown in the pictures. Clean, new and very close from the shops, bars and the underground. We highly recommend it."
1486702,355474893,2018-12-04,224107811,Burin,"This was my first trip using Airbnb and Paulo’s place was my second stay, after Bristol. I will try to make it short, this place was much better than we were expected.<br/><br/>When I browse through places to stay in London, there are many places that caught my attention but I decided to pick this place mainly from all the great reviews with nice price and location.<br/><br/>The reviews are really accurate, Paulo is a top man (I think it’s his catchphrase). He is very understanding and considerate. As we are new in town, he advised us to places and restaurants, with traveling tips. We also had a few talks about future plans and etc, which is great to share experiences. The place is nice, the bed is comfy and the location is great - few minutes walk to Sainsbury and Clapham common tube station.<br/><br/>My sister and I enjoyed staying here for 5 nights and would highly recommend other guests to stay here during their visits in London."
1486702,357415291,2018-12-10,63912288,Gloria,"Piso muy recomendable.<br/>Paulo (anfitrión) es un encanto.<br/>Nos ayudó muchísimo con el itinerario y nos aconsejó donde ir, que visitar e incluso restaurantes de todo tipo.<br/>La limpieza espectacular y la casa muy acogedora.<br/>La zona también nos gustó mucho. Tiene  mucha vida y  muchos restaurantes.<br/>Altamente recomendable"
1486702,360123007,2018-12-19,115170628,Carlotta,"Best room&experience è stata la scelta perfetta per trascorrere 5 giorni a Londra! <br/>La casa è in una posizione comodissima: vicina sia all'aeroporto di Gatwick sia al centro di Londra e alle varie attrazioni. Il quartiere è carino, sicuro e attivo (soprattutto durante il weekend). <br/>La casa è a 5 minuti dalla fermata metro e dalla via principale dove si trovano molti ristoranti, pub, supermercati.<br/>Paulo si è dimostrato un eccellente padrone di casa! È molto attento a fare sentire i benvenuti i suoi ospiti e fa di tutto per rendere la permanenza perfetta. Paulo è stato molto cordiale e ha fornito molte informazioni su cosa visitare, dove andare a mangiare ecc, si teneva sempre aggiornato sui nostri programmi. Raccomando assolutamente!"

1486702,462634841,2019-06-02,4836809,Marea,"We have stayed with Paulo on numerous occasions now and keep coming back.<br/>Paulo’s hospitality and friendliness is right up there by Airbnb standards. <br/>Whilst staying with Paulo, you are just a few minutes walk to the Clapham Common Tube Station, the High St which has everything you could need and the beautiful Clapham Common.<br/>Paulo knows London well and is happy to offer advice on things to do and see.<br/>If cleanliness is your thing then go no further. Paulo offers spotlessly clean accommodation and facilities.<br/>We look forward to staying with Paulo again some time in the future."
1486702,467316300,2019-06-10,6164035,Nimeet,"Paulo is one of the best hosts you could ask for. He is very meticulous with his communication, and provided us with quite a few local/city recommendations that came in very handy since it was our first time in London. His flat is in a very quite and safe neighborhood, with excellent proximity to Clapham common train station, as well as buses to central london. Highly recommend Paulo's flat while visiting London."
1486702,475497658,2019-06-24,183426734,Kristina,"I was drawn to Paulo’s listing for a few reasons - sharing with one person, apartment has one and a half baths, 5 minute walk to Clapham Common tube station, 5 mins to Clapham High Street - but it was the very many, paragraph long, VERY consistent reviews that sold me. <br/><br/>After requesting to book, Paulo and I had quite a bit of messaging back and forth of getting to know each other and ensuring that we were both comfortable. He wants to ensure that he’s comfortable with who he lets into his home and I, well I was confident with my choice from the get go. <br/><br/>Paulo’s place is exactly as described. He is clear with his expectations and also is very caring and open to conversation that will assist in you making the best of your stay in London. He lent me a visitor’s Oyster card as well a brolly! I couldn’t resist the small pretty ones for sale in Sainsburys - so I popped that in my purse and gave him back his very manly black umbrella. <br/><br/>If you’re the type of person/people who respects keeping a place as the host keeps his place, who is able to receive the kindness and help that the host has to offer, and who doesn’t shy away from great end of day conversation over dinner - then I’d highly recommended Paulo and his home. <br/><br/>I’m moving to London to live next year and feel very confident that I’ve made a valuable contact and friend. <br/><br/>Grazie Paulo!"
1486702,481751404,2019-07-05,83322931,Michael,"Highly recommend! The apartment is well situated only minutes to the Northern line with connections to anywhere you could want in London. Paulo is a very friendly, helpful and kind host, always up for a chat and full of helpful information about London and abroad! Prompt communication and seamless check in. Breakfast provided a nice touch! Plenty of delicious cafes around and Paulo pointed out the best spot for coffee. Can recommend to all"
1486702,486331881,2019-07-12,162573891,Caiying,"Paulo is not only a host but also a brilliant person to get along with and for tips you want in London in every sense...He’s very polite, friendly and professional as a host which amazed me a lot! If you also like traveling, food, into quality life standards, healthy life style and a bit inspiring life philosophy please please choose to become his guest! <br/><br/>And scrolling down just to check reviews about the place, I don’t need to write extra words to compliment how clean it is, how organised everything is etc."
1486702,494444676,2019-07-24,53370072,John,"Another lovely stay with Paulo our fourth. He is so helpful with suggestions of places to go. His location is great for a good supermarket,lots of venues for food and drink, and a very handy for Tube , Overground Railway, and buses."

Everything you need and a space that'll make you feel right at home <br/><br/>Host: Paulo is the man!  He's a fantastic host and is always very thoughtful. He makes you feel really comfortable and is ultra friendly. His local tips and information are worth paying for alone. Not only has he spent a long time living in London but he has been exploring the city that whole time and knows lots about it.  We really got a lot out of chatting with him and his tips for getting the London experience on a budget where very handy. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and book this room but don't tell everyone about it or it'll never be available again!

1486702,517277845,2019-08-25,258139111,Les,"Paulo was an exceptional host who went out of his way to ensure we had a wonderful stay in his home. Lots of little personal touches and great local advice on places to go, best eateries, pricing and so on. Would certainly highly recommend Paulo. You arrive as a guest and go as a friend. Thanks Paulo for making us so welcome and for all your help. Les & Barbara."
1486702,535823267,2019-09-25,70443009,Kotaro,"The house is near Clapham Common station. In the area, there are a lot of cool restaurants and tasty cafes, also a large park, which will give plenty of opportunities to feel relaxed. The accommodation was exceptionally clean and cool, which is one of the best accommodations in my experience of Airbnb. The owner, Paulo, is a really nice, kind, considerable and tiny person and always gives me a lot of information regarding the area around the house and entire London for good stay. Then, if you stay in London, you should try the accommodation!!"

The location was extraordinary -- close to everything by foot, which is truly the best way to explore London.  The sofa bed is remarkably comfy -- not one of those cheap jobs with lousy springs...this one is more like a futon bed with wooden supports beneath.  The kitchen is fully stocked, and we cooked in a couple of nights.  Everything was neat and ship-shape on arrival.  The neighborhood has great charm and a host of restaurants serving every imaginable fare with easy walking distance. Highly recommended!"
2059153,17551826,2014-08-14,7127307,Sharon,"The flat is in a wonderful location in London, and is just as described. We were able to drop our bags when we arrived in the morning, which was a big help, and then the flat was ready for us on time. It was clean and comfortable, and perfectly sized for our group (3 young adults). Leading up to the trip, communication with Jonathan was always fast and friendly. I'd happily return."
2059153,20549846,2014-10-01,2470598,Linnea,"Jonathan's flat is beautifully decorated, fully functioning, and extremely comfortable.  Communications were characterized by their courtesy and usefulness.  Paul, the friend who met us, was welcoming, thorough, and helpful, including allowing me to leave my bags for a bit on check-out day.  I would be delighted to return, and hope to do so on our next holiday to London."
2059153,22182475,2014-11-01,20072751,Maria,"Our family of four stayed five days in this charming flat. It had all we wished for and more: a perfect location with walking distance to most of the places we wanted to visit, a lovely neighbourhood with lots of restaurants, a well equipped kitchen and beautiful furnished rooms, tv and wifi for the kids. We absolutely recommend a stay in this  charming flat!"

2059153,27598370,2015-03-08,11852892,Jeff,"What a wonderful find in central London.  We've never stayed this close to the busier part of the city, and I have to say the charm, quiet, and convenience of this location and flat are hard to beat.  Jonathan and his assistaint James we great hosts, and made us feel extremely welcome.  The floorpan works great for a couple, or poss. even a family with a few children.  The eat in kitchen is charming, and a small table in there fits 2 comfortably.  Great selection of books, DVDs, and most of a real sense of the ""old world"" British charm in every detail of furnishings, fixtures, and deco, which is so unique for American's, esp. those from California."

2059153,93169401,2016-08-11,38097533,Marise,"Jonathan's place is great, right beside Oxford street. We were able to go walking to the buckingham palace, Hyde Park, Big Ben... It provides privacy as the living room and the bedroom have good doors. The kitchen utensils have high quality. Paul received us and was very gentle when helping us with the luggage. My only suggestion would be to make some adjustments on the sofabed on the living room, as it has a little inclination that makes heads a little ""down"" (and when you lay down the opposite side, there is a part of the structure that bothers). <br/><br/>O apartamento é ótimo, fica logo ao lado da Oxford Street. Podíamos ir andando ao Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park e Big Ben. Permite privacidade pois tanto o quarto como a sala de estar possuem portas. Os utensílios de cozinha são de ótima qualidade. Paul nos recebeu e foi muito gentil nos ajudando com as malas. Minha única sugestão seria fazer algum tipo de ajuste no sofá cama da sala, pois ele tem uma pequena inclinação que faz as cabeças ficarem ""baixas"" (e quando deitamos do lado oposto, tem uma parte da estrutura que incomoda)."

We used Uber to get here and there because we don't walk well now that we're a bit older.  Appreciated the elevator in the building.  It was nice to come home and be able to relax and watch a movie, instead of being in a typical, tiny London hotel room. We really enjoyed our stay."

Jonathan allowed us to check-in early as our train from Paris arrived at 11 am. The housekeeper was outside the building when we arrived and he welcomed us and showed us the apartment. The apartment was very clean, smelled really clean and sheets and towels were hotel quality. The apartment was very near eating places and we were so happy to eat at Nandos. Then we walked to Oxford street and started window shopping. No need to take the tube or taxi to get to Oxford. <br/>The apartment was complete... we were able to wash and dry clothes, there was hair dryer, red, microwave, and even dishwashing machine was available. The apartment is on the second floor (3rd) and it's good there is an elevator in the building although there are about 5 steps to go to the elevator. We hope that Jonathan will let us stay here again when we visit London next time. Thank you."
2059153,147682445,2017-04-28,21604092,Joanne,"Grab this gem of a flat if you can. The deep cornices and woodwork give it a lovely period feel.Each room is painted a color that complements the art work and furnishing.Ample hot water for long showers (not hand held...) or soaks in the deep tub, comfortable seating, books and DVDs, well supplied kitchen. The house manager is responsive and knowledgable. The flat is located close to an underground station and near the British Museum. The real glory for us was the amazing architecture on buildings in the neighborhood. Every walk we took revealed more treasures.<br/>We highly recommend this flat."

Super bien ubicado en una callecita tranquila c pequeños restaurantes. El subte queda a solo dos  cuadras. Tambien tenes un sturbucks y un cafe nero cerca. Y lo mejor fue m&s donde podes comprar comida gourmet ya lista y con aolo calentarla teniamos la cena lista con precios super economicos. Excelente departamento! Super recomendable"
2059153,195962948,2017-09-21,134695329,Bev,"We rented Jonathan's flat for a month. We love Fitzrovia and the flat is ideally located, with all things accessible - great restaurants, good markets, wonderful pubs - a true neighborhood. The heart of London is in all directions, with great walks to Soho, Bloomsbury, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Trafalgar...and beyond. We walk to most theatres in the West End as well. The flat itself is accurately depicted online. It is amply furnished and has everything one needs for full apartment living, which is exactly what we desired. When we had a question, a request or a special need, Jonathan's manager Sreto, was terrific. He lives around the corner and was always available to assist (including when we locked ourselves out of the flat). Although we never met Jonathan, I communicated with him prior to and during our stay - he was nothing less than professional and courteous. One issue arose and Jonathan dealt with it immediately, efficiently and fairly. I would not hesitate to rent from him in the future, as we visit London regularly (he has several flats in the neighborhood)."
2059153,207540574,2017-10-29,5351177,Simona,Perfect flat in great and vibrant neighbourhood. Special atmosphere in the apartment. Stylish and cosy. Fast respond from jonathan and sreto. Would highly recommend. And will definetely return.

Safe neighbourhood. Clean towels and bed sheets etc., even went out of their way to purchase a high chair for our son on the day of check in and left this in the flat for us. We would highly recommend this place! Thanks again for the hospitality."
2059153,274488549,2018-06-09,170385248,Kathleen,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  Spectacular location, and would return for that reason alone.  Our on site host Sreto was very accommodating, checking in regularly to make sure we were happy.  Easy stroll to Oxford St shopping. The flat is comfortable and very well equipped, more like a home than a rental. Stayed for 12 days and didn't exhaust marvelous restaurant options within a short stroll.  Dim Sum resto and Roka at end of street both exceptional, although quite different price point."
2059153,281120475,2018-06-24,22936759,Randall P.,GREAT location! Very easy access to the place and great communication. Would definitely stay there again!

2059153,288698370,2018-07-10,33245885,Siddharth,"We just came back from a stay at Jonathan’s place in Fitzrovia. The place is accurately described and Jonathan and his house keeper were amazing hosts. The home is London sized but was ideal for family of 4. Restaurants, groceries were nearby and it was easy to take a taxi from this location. The kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans as well as all the basic amenities. The home has an amazing collection of books which we also enjoyed browsing. Overall a very nice stay. The only challenge we experienced was the extremely hot London Summer in 2018 and the apartment like most others is not air conditioned. We ended up keeping the window open at night and experienced noise from restaurants and pub below. Other than this minor weather issue we liked the house very much and Setko (the housekeeper) was always available and very helpful!"

We loved the amenities and the decorations, and it was perfectly furnished.<br/><br/>The location of the flat is terrific for hopping on the Tube, or for walking anywhere you want to go in Bloomsbury, Soho, Fitzrovia, etc. Also, despite being in a vibrant area, there are two layers of window glass in the living room, which made for a quiet night's sleep (the bedroom and kitchen face a peaceful, silent courtyard).  Finally, communication with both Jonathan and Sreto was fast and helpful. I highly recommend this flat!"

2059153,310370106,2018-08-19,63737897,Shevane,Jonathan’s place is very central and very convenient. Everything was walking distance to trendy restaurants to a grocery store. As it is in heart of the city so noise is a factor. We are from NYC so it didn’t bother us. The place is immaculate and had more than basic amenities. Jonathan was very accommodating as we arrived late at night. His manager was there to hand over the keys and gave my husband a quick tour of the area. It was very helpful.

I had to book a room fast, so I didn't know exactly what to expect. I'm very happy to say that Tiziana is a great host, she makes you feel right at home from the very beginning. She is very kind and respectful. If you have a question she is always there for you, trying to make your stay as pleasant as possible. As I say, Italian hospitality at its best! About the flat, it is completely renovated and everything is clean, neat and tidy. I loved the fact that there is no carpet throughout the house, I've really enjoyed having the wooden floor. The room I slept in is really nice and cozy, with a wonderful bed and mattress. It's been awhile since I slept this well! Last but not least, the flat is linked very well to Central London, you can take the tube or bus, the choice is yours. Stratford and the Westfield mall are also really close, just a 10 minute commute by bus. I will surely recommend Tiziana's place to my friends and relatives visiting London. Thank you Tiziana! :)"
2673638,12441332,2014-05-02,14555297,Leonardo,"Loved Tiziana's apartment, situated in a good location in London, closed to the tube station and bus stop. Tiziana is nice and helpful. Very clean and tidy.  I would certainly recommend this apartment."

La maison est bien située car elle est à 3 minutes à pied de la station de metro. C'est une maison avec une chambre assez grande et le reste de la maison est accessible tout le temps. Tout est très propre et derrière il y a un jardin très agréable. J'ai passé une semaine super et surtout j'ai très bien dormi car l'endroit est calme et la literie est parfaite. <br/><br/>Je vous recommande cette location !!! "
2673638,18058788,2014-08-21,1832835,H,A wonderful place.  Thank you for the great stay.
2673638,663183794,2020-09-12,353184852,Luca,"Tiziana is far more than a host, she is a friend you can always count on when in London. Feel free to ask her whatever you need and she will be happy to give you all kinds of advice. It was a pleasure to meet her. The house -two steps away from one of the main Tube lines- is cozy, clean and bright and the bed is incredibly comfortable."

We were welcomed the Italian way with a real Italian espresso!  We were invited to use the kitchen anytime we wanted and were also invited to have lunch withe him and friends to following day. The apartment was tidy and clean. He also provided us with useful recommendations for places to eat or have a nice coffee or glass of wine. <br/>For us the perfect location, quiet and with direct acces to metro and bike rental."

The underground is one minute away and if you walk just one block you'll get to Portobello road where you have lots of restaurants and shops, and on the weekend Portobello market. Massimo is a great person, very attentive, helpful, and considerate. We thought we just needed a place to sleep and that a host wasn't important but once you meet Massimo you understand how a host makes a big difference. He answered all the questions we had, helped us in any way he could, and went above and beyond all our expectations. He kept us informed of what was going on in London and gave us many tips and recommendations. He and his friend even prepared some Italian dishes for us several times and it was delicious! Totally recommend Massimo and would stay in his flat again."

He sent us lots of information ahead on how to reach the apartment by public transportation and even met us at the bus stop! He was super helpful in suggesting interesting things to do around London.

We are looking forward to visit again next time we are in London!"
3327563,36890615,2015-07-02,34131891,Maria Luisa,"We found Massimo's house really very comfortable and spacious. He has been an outstanding hoster and the passion that he put in this role is evident. He has been reliable, very present and always ready to come towards to every our needs;the kitchen was to our complete disposal and it offered the possibility to have a breakfast lunch and dinner very abundant . also.

3327563,37736540,2015-07-10,6232638,Barbara,We had an absolutely fantastic stay with Massimo. He was super hospitable and we got to try his famous pasta which is really really good!!! The house and the toilet was also very clean. It's also a stone's throw to the tube and has buses that take you into the heart of London. We would definitely come back and stay if we're back in London. 
3327563,38376688,2015-07-15,30639304,Julia,"Merci à Massimo pour ce fabuleux séjour chez lui ! Accueil plus que chaleureux, Massimo a vraiment le souci du bien-être de ses hôtes !!!

3327563,39396199,2015-07-23,24583118,Victor,Because of our schedule we could not make it to Massimo's flat until about 11 in the evening and he was gracious enough to wait for us and welcome us.  The room and the apartment was very clean!  Our room was especially quiet-considering that this was a busy area.  Massimo recommended a number of good restaurants the area and we were a little bummed out that we did not get to try all of them and we didn't get to try Massimo's pasta  (maybe on our next visit my friend eh?).  Grocery store is about a block away.  For the price this place was a REALLY good find!
3327563,40095088,2015-07-28,20705218,Agustina,"Massimo fue un excelente anfitrión, siempre atento a todas las necesidades que tuvimos y súper cálido. Su lugar es impecable, totalmente recomendable para moverse sin problemas por Londres porque está muy conectado con una estación de metro ubicada a pocos pasos y en un barrio de ensueño como Notting Hill. Fue la mejor experiencia de AirBNB que tuvimos ¡y ya queremos volver! No duden en contactar a Massimo, alguien confiable que además los hará sentir como en casa. "
3327563,40613557,2015-08-01,8223015,Phillip,"We very much enjoyed our stay here. Massimo is an excellent host and has a nice setup. His directions and communications with us were very clear and helpful. His place is only 50 meters from a tube station in a very vibrant area. There are many good Pubs, restaurants and shops nearby. Also walking distance to Little Venice with a nice walking path along the canal. We found his place to be clean and quiet. This was a great place for our London stay and we only hope it is available for a return trip someday. "
3327563,47367244,2015-09-18,6076234,Paige,"Our stay with Massimo was one of the best Airbnb experiences we've ever had. The room was big, bright, and had all the necessary amenities you could want. It's in a great location, the Portobello road market is especially fun on the weekends. Massimo was a fantastic host - extremely communicative, very friendly, and was pretty much our personal tour guide. He always made sure that we were doing okay and had great recommendations for sites to see and places to eat. He even helped us get some discounts on a few restaurants as well. We had a lot of fun exploring London with him, and would highly recommend staying at his place. Definitely worth it!"
3327563,48546714,2015-09-27,15912936,Rajesh,"The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. 2sets of 3 towels were tastefully placed in the room. Massimo was one of the best hosts you can find. He was there to receive us. He had even booked a taxi for us from the airport (paid for by us). Helped us take the luggage upto the room. He took us around to show the neighbourhood the metro and the eating places. He genuinely cares for his guests comfort and wellbeing. He insisted and cooked us a lovely dinner. He was there for any doubt problem you had on any thing. Had the most wonderful time. He even took care of laundry for us. Before we knew it he had loaded our taxi for our return. All positives!!!! Only you have to share the one toilet with the occupants of the two other rooms. We had a good understanding with the other guests so it was fine. Thanks again for the wonderful and memorable time we had with you. You made us feel at home"
3327563,49144565,2015-10-01,42940202,Tony,The best experience ever! Massimo was amazing . I arrived to London around 12:30 AM and Massimo  was waiting for my arrival . The next morning he showed me around the neighborhood and took me to his favorite coffee shop. It was my first time in London I was nervous on how to find the tube station. Again Massimo walked with me about a mile and a half to show me the station. At night I was invited for homemade pasta and  caprese  salad and beer. If I can give Massimo More than five star a would . Grazie mille massimo 
3327563,51488460,2015-10-20,45974148,Petar,"Firstly, Massimo is wonderful ! morning coffee, socialize , walk around the block .. completely feels like you're at home and you have a friend in London who has long been familiar .<br/>Secondly, the apartment was beautiful , clean, tidy , kitchen is full , you can make tea or coffee ( although Massimo is doing real fine Italian espresso ) , and a simple breakfast .

3396807,480773013,2019-07-03,77922290,Ankur,"The place was very well located , very close to the station and the bus stop. Takes approx 30 mins to get to oxford circus<br/><br/>The place has only 2 shower and one tub which was an issue coz we found it difficult to get ready in the morning <br/><br/>The kitchen and the drawing open room with a back garden was good where we could all sit around <br/><br/>The biggest issue was that the house was totally lived in. The family had their things , clothes , posters , shoes everything every where , the cupboards were full of their stuff. This was most dissapointing."
3461949,17958221,2014-08-19,18813884,Tommaso,"We were very good! <br/>The house is in a quiet area, silent, well served by bus, not the subway. <br/>There are many supermarkets, pubs and restaurants nearby. <br/>The house is cute although not very functional for guests - a few spaces available, the absence of a blanket, short sheets, weak stream of the shower ... -. They could pay more attention to cleaning and order. <br/>Recommended for young and adaptable couples!"
3461949,42299206,2015-08-12,36891697,Edoardo,Nice flat and area. We've had a really good stay and the apartment is very cute and functional. 
3461949,52544729,2015-10-30,6448958,John,"Joe was really easy to communicate with. He was away when we arrived, but his friend who checked us in was really friendly and also easy to get hold of. <br/><br/>The flat was lovely, cosy (in a good way), and even nicer than we expected. <br/><br/>Transport was really close, and all of the shops we needed were close by.<br/><br/>Great host, and highly recommended."
3461949,58350577,2016-01-02,11839359,Elisabeth,The stay at Joseph's place was excellent. The apartment is lovely and the location is very convenient. Joseph made the whole process very easy. Definitely recommend this place.
3461949,244269663,2018-03-18,69529445,Elise,"Very cosy apartment when you get used to it. But we had some problems with the cleanliness. Very dirty bathroom and kitchen with rotten food laying around. The whole place is surrounded by dead plants and dust. But other than that it's a nice authentic and cheap place with lots of space.  Joseph is super friendly and helpful, but needs to be a bit more professional when it comes to feedback."
3461949,248401496,2018-03-31,149430253,Michaela,"I moved to London a couple of weeks ago and needed a place to stay while looking for a place. Joe's flat was perfect for the purpose, as it is a quiet lived-in apartment with all amenities one needs. The location in Camberwell is great, too, and Joe was responding very quickly to all the questions I had. Highly recommended!"
3461949,509224352,2019-08-14,126110590,Sophie,"Le logement a beau sembler un peu loin du centre ville, il est parfaitement desservi à toute heure par de nombreuses lignes de bus. Il a l'avantage d'être en zone 2 ce qui présente un avantage économique pour les cartes de transport. Joseph est très accueillant et attentionné, il est très réactif et arrangeant. L'appartement est plutôt spacieux, suffisant pour 2 personnes et parfait pour les amateurs de musique (disques vinyles, instruments en tout genre...). Toutefois, gros bémol de l'appartement : la chambre est très mal insonorisée et la rue est souvent très bruyante la nuit et le matin. Sommeils légers, pensez à prendre des boules Quies."
3461949,518860069,2019-08-27,169312407,Johanna,"Joseph is a great host, very friendly and helpful. I felt very safe in Camberwell, public transport was highly reliable and easy to use. The apartment was clean, comfy and cozy, with everything I needed and more than that. Definitely recommend this one for 1-2 people."

3519290,15984225,2014-07-19,17909743,Allan,Andrew's an amazing host. Very personable and accommodating. His apartment is clean and has a pleasant modern style. It's lovely location that benefits any short term commutes into London or taking in the Olympic park amenities. I really found Andrew a good communicator and is a genuinely nice guy. I totally recommend him as a host
3519290,16316912,2014-07-25,17909743,Allan,Andrew is truly an amazing host. He's a great communicator and his home is exceptionally clean and design to meet almost every need. It's a modern building that is super close to all amenities for commuting to London without the pretentiousness of a London address. I would fully recommend him as a host without any hesitation. I would certainly book his place again
3519290,17381740,2014-08-11,18633896,George,"Very easy to deal with Andrew; quick to respond, flexible and helpful. "
3519290,22732506,2014-11-13,16281287,Adewale,"Andrew was a very welcoming, warm host. When I got to the house, he showed me everything I needed to know. He also wanted to know if I were comfortable and whether I needed anything else. He offered me red wine all the time. We exchange text messages all the time as if we know ourselves for ages. The location is not too far from Westfield, two Tube stations about 7 minutes away (walking). The room was clean and the sheets and towels smelled good. That helped to feel homey. Pros: - Good price - Nice host - when I left Andrew, we continue communicating, he wanted to know how i enjoy my stay. I REALLY liked that! - Clean place - Kitchen available - Lots of places to eat - Located on a main road. Andrew is a good & welcoming host, which is very important to me. - I will go there again with my entire family."

He looks like a friend more than a host.<br/>The room was comfortable, clean, with nice prepared flowers. While we needed, Andrew also helped to provide international adapter and hair dryer for us promptly. The kitchen is with all the equipment and seasoning you need, and the toilet was very clean as well.<br/>He has a rare gift of hospitality as he knows to hold the balance of being in your space, and leaving you alone when needed. <br/>Can only give my highest recommendations!"
3519290,27608880,2015-03-08,20311643,Luke,"Andrew: The quintessential host - hospitable, easy going, thoughtful, reliable, flexible, sharing!

No complaints !  <br/><br/>The location: The Westfield Stratford Mall next door offers access to everywhere you need to be. Easy access to transportation systems into central London via the DLR, High speed railway and Underground. <br/><br/>Overall - 5 star experience ! "
3519290,27937917,2015-03-15,27557329,Bogdanka,"The apartment was as described by the host - brand new, clean and welcoming. The neighborhood is safe and very nice. Andrew was pleasant, helpful and very accommodating. He went to great lengths to give us privacy, we appreciated that very much, we just hope it did not inconvenience him when we were arriving late after long day of sightseeing. We recommend staying with Andrew if you are stopping in London in the future! <br/>"
3519290,28168124,2015-03-19,27353614,Claire,"Andrew was a great host. Provided helpful information before we arrived and then made us feel very welcome when we stayed with him. Great location. East Village is a lovely area and easy to get to. The apartment is great, has everything you need and is exceptionally clean and tired. Andrew provided everything we needed and was most helpful with local knowledge, directions etc We will definitely stay with him again when we are next in the area. "
3519290,29310389,2015-04-06,29172756,Jeroen,"Room was nice and comfortable. The building is new. The location perfect if you need to be close to the Olympic Park. 5 minutes walking to Stratford station. Andrew was a good host, let us free to use the appartment to our likings. Positive."

Location is perfect for access to rail/bus transport, parks, and shopping. Apartment is new, clean, spacious and very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again in the future. "
3519290,33079363,2015-05-25,27879119,Michael,"Two thumbs up for an excellent AirBnB experience! Andrew was a great host, and personally picked us up from Stratford station. He is friendly and easy to talk to, and is more than happy to provide his tips on the town or just to have a chat. The room itself is exactly as pictured, being very clean with bright modern decor. We loved the location, as its surrounded by busy shops and restaurants, as well as a few mins walk from Stratford station - a major intersecting line on the London rail network. Further, Stratford also has a special rail line that takes you direct to interstate rail services. This was great for us, as we left for France via Eurostar thereafter. Overall, Andrew's apartment was one of our best AirBnB experiences whilst traveling through Europe."

The location was good with lots of fresh fruit and veg and butchers along the main road. It was easy to get all around with the tube about 10mins walk and buses on every other corner. We enjoyed our stay, thanks! "

Small Tesco grocery store nearby and great little kitchen for cooking meals. Flat has fun British decor and enough comfortable space for 2 people. Host Andrew was awesome and kept in touch with us before and during our stay. Note that the unit is up a couple narrow flights of stairs. Apart from a few maintenance issues, this flat was a great air bnb find for a week in London!"

3519290,230151009,2018-01-27,14300644,Mariana,"I absolutely loved staying in this gem of a flat. Andrew, the host, couldn’t have been more thoughtful or attentive. From putting out fresh flowers and fruit, to stocking up the fridge with juice and milk, not to mention help with my bag on arrival - I really couldn’t have asked for a better host. <br/>Having a small supermarket just across the road and loads of great restaurants near by (particularly good sushi), the flat is perfect.<br/>The little balcony is fabulous for a bit of fresh air and the interior is a great layout with everything you need for a visit to London. <br/>I will definitely try and stay there again.<br/>Thank you Andrew."
3519290,258572396,2018-04-29,160724887,Mit,Stayed in Andrews flat for almost 3 months.  Had a great experience overall.  Location is good with nearby bus n tube stops within half a mile n near plenty of restaurants.  He was kind enough to provide cleaning every 2 weeks for me as well which was awesome.  Overall no major issues n would definitely stay again if i returned to London!!
3519290,262569422,2018-05-09,15117544,Tyson,"I've booked Andrew's apartment for my parents, they stayed there for 9 days. Andrew is the definition of the perfect host: good local tips, nice gestures like putting flowers and fruit to welcome my parents, everything was very clean and the communication was perfect. The apartment is a good choice for a couple, with a nice balcony to get some lunch or dinner, if the weather is good. There is plenty of groceries in the surroundings, including a massive Morrisons 5 mins away. The Finsbury Park station is also just 10 mins far away walking.<br/>It was a very good experience in general :)"
3519290,268928293,2018-05-26,43594294,Linda,"Flat was exactly as described, modern, clean, well equipped and very comfortable.  Love the vibrant neighbourhood, close to shops, many great restaurants, parks and very accessible to Central London by the tube or bus.  Can't say enough about the host , Andrew.  Andrew always responded quickly during the booking process, and while we didn't need to contact him during our stay in London I am sure if we had any concerns he would have dealt with them swiftly.  On our arrival he was there to show us around the flat and help with the luggage and came back to help again when we left.  The welcoming touches were very much appreciated after a long flight, food, flowers and other nice things....he made us feel like we were family rather than paying guests.  Five stars plus, plus, plus."
3519290,274093406,2018-06-08,127061947,Ulysses,"Andrew is a really great host. He gets back to you very fast.  He was very understanding and made sure I was taken care of, and that I understood everything about the apartment.  The place itself was great too, and close to public transportation."

He was very flexible with our check  in and checkout. Our day stay was great the place was clean and the amenities were perfect. we had a great time visiting London for the first time and Andrew made it that way. The location of the air bnb was great! Definitely stay here!
3519290,423882530,2019-03-15,2298164,Nicole,"Hands down the best experience I’ve had on Airbnb. Andrew is a superhost for a reason. He was very quick to respond to any questions I had, so friendly and easy to communicate with. He has so many great recommendations in the neighborhood and in general just made life easy when it came to settling in a new place on my own. <br/><br/>This flat is lovely, exactly what you see in the photos - chic, completely clean, spacious and stocked with anything you might need for your stay. He’s really thought of everything — high speed WiFi, Netflix, all the cooking utensils you might need, closer space, you name it. I was there for over two months and it really felt like home. Great to have a nicely sized living room to relax and unwind, washer and dishwasher in the kitchen. Plus the balcony is a nice bonus, it was lovely to sit out there on warm days! Finsbury Park station makes transport to nearly anywhere in London easy and fast. Lots of restaurants and great supermarkets in the neighborhood and I felt extremely safe there.<br/><br/>Can’t thak you enough Andrew!"
3519290,464357859,2019-06-05,8028177,Christopher,"The space was as described, but there was a smell of cigarettes in the apartment, and we are non smokers..<br/>The are is cool and easy to get to on Tube and bus, with good connections to many places.<br/>There was a party upstairs from us one night which kept us awake until 3am, so that was a bummer, but I communicated that with the host and it didn't happen again.<br/>We enjoyed our stay."
3519290,497322746,2019-07-28,167292539,Jiangwei,"Andrew is a five star host. He is kind and considerate, always ready to help! The place is wonderful for my stay in town. I really enjoyed this trip partly because Andrew offered this great accommodation to us!"
3519290,519894452,2019-08-29,111119428,희진,한국인후기가 없어서 한국말로 후기를 씁니다. 이 집은 두 사람이 지내기에 적합한 아주 귀여운 집입니다. <br/>호스트는 아주 친절하고 따뜻한 사람입니다. 세탁기도 작동이 잘 되고 침대도 매우 편안합니다. 특히 교통이 매우 편리합니다. 주변에 마트도 많아서 장 보기에도 편했습니다. 옆건물 1층 정션마켓에 있는 태국음식점은 정말 맛집이었습니다. 앤드류에게 매우 감사합니다.
3519290,539842624,2019-10-02,211218655,John,"Andrew was incredibly helpful and friendly from start to finish and made the whole Airbnb experience a breeze. His apartment is well decorated and had everything we needed, including excellent access to public transport. I'll definitely look to book with Andrew again next time I'm in London. Thanks  mate!"
3519290,559624692,2019-11-04,264075410,Ville,"Andrew's place is just the right one to choose, be it for a shorter trip or a month's stay as myself. I could not have hoped for anything more: hot water all the time, good heating even in the zero Celsius mornings of October, super safe neighborhood,  comfortable bed, fast wifi,  spotless surfaces, the list just goes on. This guy is a superhost for a reason!"
3519290,570849483,2019-11-30,198840168,Carlyn,Andrew is a great host with a comfortable modern home. The apartment was extremely clean and in a convenient location with excellent transport links. I also found the area to be extremely safe and Andrew made it easy to communicate and ensured everything was well. I’d recommend Andrew’s place and would definitely enjoy staying there again when I’m in London next.
3519290,576339148,2019-12-13,289087752,Sherif,"Very nice clean place. Lots of fragrant shampoos and scented hand soap even in the kitchen. Comprehensive electrical appliances including WiFi, big TV, washing machine and iron.<br/>Andrew is a very friendly guy always in touch. The neighbourhood is also very friendly with lots of shops for all types of food. Transport is very easy with buses and underground very near."
3519290,589046004,2020-01-05,20941316,Daniel,"Our London gem. It was a nearly located apartment that was close to where we needed to be. The unit had a lot of areas to keep our luggage and our purchases. Andrew was especially helpful in giving us insights on what was nearby and was always very communicative. The underground station was a 10 min. walk, which made transport quite simple."
3519290,619020164,2020-03-16,334687487,Ashwath,"The apartment itself is great. It has a nice cozy feeling and Andrew has done his best to ensure that guests are supplied with all the necessary household items they need. The location is also amazing. It’s near to the tube station, so getting around London is pretty easy (bonus points if you’re an Arsenal fan haha, the Emirates is a short distance away). To top things off, Andrew is a great host. He takes note of the little things to ensure that your welcome to the apartment is as warm as possible. He’s also been very helpful in answering my queries and giving me recommendations on the various sites and places to visit in London. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, and I highly recommend this apartment "

The place will give you a true London feeling for your stay if you’re not local, and is very well connected by transportation. Also incredibly well stocked, I had no need buying any staples for my 1 month long stay. Thanks Andrew, hope to be back!"
3519290,494747368550911682,2021-11-13,42799695,Diana,"Andrew was absolutely wonderful before, during, and after our stay in our flat. He was so attentive upon our arrival and was kind enough to stock the flat with items for our immediate needs without my asking. The space was a perfect fit for two people and everything was perfectly neat and organized with the guest in mind. Plenty of storage, cookware, comfortable bed, light blocking curtains, and roomy living room made for a great 2-week stay. It is also in a fantastic location for accessing all bus and tube routes into the center of the city. I will certainly be returning to enjoy Andrew's hospitality!"
3634802,24051485,2014-12-18,1680933,Anke,"This place is probably in one of the best locations in the city.<br/>Restaurants, bars, coffee shops all within a few feet and walking to any of the major sightseeing spots is easy and fun.<br/><br/>Marcela, was great and even left a birthday card and present with us for our friend whose 40ieth birthday party had given us all a reason to travel to London. There were 4 us and we could have easily fitted more people. <br/><br/>Overall great experience, very responsive and professional host.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>anke"
3634802,25719766,2015-01-24,25783829,Seamus,We were greeted by the Host Marcela on the first day. She was fantastic and more then helpful always. She was always easy to communicate with as well. The place is perfect for a group wanting to stay in the heart of soho (and London for that matter!). It is as described in the add and is very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again next time in London!
3634802,30876268,2015-04-28,2340632,Johanna,The location of this place is excellent. Right in the heart of Soho. The apartment was as described in the photos and Marcela was nice and helpful. We enjoyed our stay. Thanks again.
3634802,36552428,2015-06-29,33960731,Adi,"Marcella was very welcoming and the communication we had with her was great. <br/>The property has a fantastic location, very central and convenient for Oxford St, Tottenham Court road and Covent Garden. The property is presented very well and there was enough room for four adults and four children ranging in age from 13 to 2. <br/>We arrived in from Waterloo Train station and a taxi was approximately £11.<br/>Very happy with our stay and would happily rent from Marcella in the future.<br/>"
3634802,39010615,2015-07-20,33761922,Tiffany,"My family and I enjoyed a fantastic weekend at Soho House, the accommodation was incredibly clean, tidy and well equipped and the location was ideal as it is just off the main busy area of Soho and a short walk to China Town.  Our host Marcela was welcoming, extremely helpful and quick to respond to any queries.  We would highly recommend Marcela and the house in Soho for a large party looking for somewhere in central London as a base.  "
3634802,43756019,2015-08-22,24500068,Alicia,After 6 weeks traveling through Europe what a magnificent end to our trip. The house was just as it looked in the pictures. The location is superb right in the heart of soho but on a quiet street. Our host was kind enough to let us leave our bags for the day after we departed. We couldn't fault this accommodation & highly recommend it to anyone looking for a blissful stay in London!
3634802,45936348,2015-09-07,29971881,Stephen,We loved staying here in Soho<br/>So very central to everything<br/><br/>
3634802,47141585,2015-09-16,29736290,Ofek,"The apartment was just what we were expecting:<br/>* Central positioned, but yet quiet since it is situated in a court.<br/>* Small but well equipped kitchen - just the write size for our needs.<br/>* Every thing was clean and well maintained.<br/><br/>We were a bit surprised by the way the toilets are located (inside one of the rooms on 2nd floor and not for both rooms usage) but it was not an issue, and the other room shared the separated toilets on the 3rd floor.<br/><br/>Victor (our contact person) was helpful and friendly.<br/><br/>We got help booking transportation to and from Luton airport, and that was a great help."
3634802,61052692,2016-01-31,19720587,Zoe,"Great apartment, great location. We had a small issue with the hot water but it was all sorted in the end. Thank you!"
3634802,63170350,2016-02-21,51671015,Kiki,"All in all, the location could not be beat! We were literally in the heart of Soho (with the pros and cons associated with it) and it was mere minutes to our office where we worked for two weeks.<br/><br/>We totalled 5 individual people over a two week period with max of 3 people per week. The house is quite centralised and the communications with Marcela and the greeter fantastic. We did find ourselves recognising the opportunity for a few simple creature comforts during our stay to make it a bit more warm and home like. <br/><br/>The fact that the house is more on the historic side added to the charm but it also increased the need for a few extras.<br/><br/>Our Cheers<br/>- Location; location; location<br/>- Size of rooms<br/>- Linen replacement / servicing after we switched groups half way through<br/>- Car service arrangement<br/>- Greeter and communications throughout the stay<br/>- Ease of departure<br/>- Washer / Dryer in unit<br/>- Electric kettle<br/>- Extra heaters! It got cold / damp a few nights<br/>- Hair dryers<br/>- On demand water heating<br/><br/>Uncontrollable—The neighbourhood is going through a lot of construction / renovations.<br/>- Pigeons flying into the window at 3am! They seem to like to perch along the bedroom windows<br/>- Noisy street; public urination by doorway (ah … Soho). We had to rinse down the pavement around the front door one morning to get rid of the smell.<br/>- Taring from renovation work at building next door; burning smell made us first thing that something in the house was burning"
3634802,69142081,2016-04-09,64923336,James,"Lovely place in an excellent location. Hosts were accommodating and flexible, and took care of any minor issues or questions promptly. Highly recommended for a great place to stay in London!"

The benefits of staying in such a great location are hard to overstate.<br/>More spacious that I would have expected - living/eating area is quite large<br/>Decent kitchen, washer/dryer, dish washer<br/>Excellent and responsive property management<br/>Property has its own exclusive entrance, it's basically a townhouse<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Soho can be loud at night, though this didn't stop us sleeping<br/>Furnishings are all good and functional, but not exceptional<br/>Property has 3 flights of stairs to the very top bedroom, so if you have mobility issues that could be a problem<br/><br/>"

3634802,77663544,2016-06-02,18016539,Hans And Courtney,"Great location! Kayla was fantastic. She answered so promptly. Washer/dryer was so nice to have. It was hard for small children as top to bottom the house is on 4 stories with very narrow stairs. We blocked off the stairs with our luggage at night. Any child 6 or over should be fine. It was also noisy at night. But if you are there for the night life then this location is fabulous!! <br/><br/>You do need to buy your own toilet paper, napkins, paper towels, garbage bags, facial tissue, etc after the first toilet paper roll but the tesco is just down the street so it wasn't a big deal. <br/><br/>If you like boba tea then there is a bubbleology on your way to China town and a place called Viet Food right at the entrance to China town that we found and the pho is EXCELLENT. We have been back a ton! "
3634802,81412217,2016-06-22,286650,John And Nina,"This place was perfect for our party of 10. It was roomy, comfortable, safe and close to the metro stop as well as our location for meeting the hop on hop off bus. Had everything we needed to make our stay easy and enjoyable.  Host was very helpful in explaining everything and giving us recommendations. Thank you! "
3634802,83279012,2016-07-02,5809121,Queenie,"Hosts are very friendly and nice. The apartment is spacious and clean, looking exactly the same as the pictures. Location is perfect (right next to Oxford Street), just that there may be some noises at night because of the bars nearby, but I guess it is hard to avoid if you would like to stay in city center. Overall it was a very pleasant stay at Marcela's apartment."
3634802,85623008,2016-07-12,61172873,Lori,"Klara was there to meet us at the house, helped orient us and get us settled. Great location, beautiful home with everything we needed. Nice that hair dryers and electric adapters in home for use.  All in all,a great visit!  One word of advice for visitors- don't overpack because lots of stairs to carry your bags!"

3634802,99796312,2016-09-06,29677860,Linda,"Marcela tried to check us in early and allowed us to leave our luggage for a later check out.  A misunderstanding happened when guests had left a fit bit on a counter and when he returned it was moved.  The cleaning crew had moved it yet they could not communicate the answer to the guest.  Language barrier!  Yet the conflict was only explained to me because a repair cost was disputed and Marcela was not in good humor.  The repair cost is still an issue! The washer was damaged, never did we notice the damage and we do not know how this damage happened. (or when it happened) I should be grateful for not being charged for the damaged living room couch, door jams or other multiple issues that where there when we arrived. Location is the only factor that makes this listing attractive!"

3634802,110220845,2016-10-24,75572475,Robert,Flat was as advertised. Slept 8 comfortably.  Location is amazing right in the heart of soho- can't be beat.  Marcella was wonderful answering questions prior to trip in very timely manner.  Her staff was on time for letting us in and showing us around the flat.  The experience was perfect.  Highly recommend the unit. 
3634802,120147802,2016-12-08,22318017,Bella,Klara was great and very communicative. The place was in a great location and very easy to get everywhere. The place is big and spacious and clean. 
3634802,122241552,2016-12-22,52841003,Kimberley,Would highly recommend. Flat exactly as described. Location walking distance to everything. So many food / dinning and party options around. A+++ for  communication. Organised an early check in and could not fault the stay.
3634802,122974168,2016-12-26,17157665,Bjørn Gunnar,No problems according to this flat. Communication was Perfect. We had a wonderful Christmas celebration in very Central London. For musicfans: Trident studio just 35 meters Down the alley and Paul McCartneys Office just around the corner......:)

3634802,140511999,2017-03-30,20208240,Jessica,This a spacious and comfortable place to land in London...and the location is great!
3634802,148665426,2017-05-01,14111668,Jan,"An entire three storage small typical Soho building. Super central. Close to shopping areas, China Town, Musicals,...<br/>The owners are friendly and communication is easy. Cleaners forgot to put toilet papers. An hour and a half after a short conversation, the issue was solved. Great service, great house, great location."
3634802,150130327,2017-05-07,106041730,Karina,"The apartment is located super central which is amazing, especially if you won't travel further than zone 2.<br/>We were 11 girls staying there, but only really needed the apartment to sleep there and store some food for breakfast. We only cooked once but for 3 and that was fine, as the dinner table only has 6 seats.<br/>It gets a bit noisy and that's quite noticeable at night when trying to fall asleep, but as we were exhausted that wasn't a problem either  one thing that should be taken into account is that one of the bathrooms doesn't have a door but a curtain, and the living room doesn't have a door (nor a curtain) either which can be a little bit inconvenient for the people sleeping there (). But all in all, we had everything we needed: bedsheets & blankets, towels & extra towels for everyone! We had a lovely, warm stay.<br/><br/>Klara was amazing communicating with us and very understanding, and I can only recommend staying at one of her flats!<br/>"
3634802,171249571,2017-07-17,23355512,Matt,"Good apartment in the heart of Soho.  We were able to walk and tube everywhere with ease.  <br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Location- Soho is happening and close to a ton of theaters and restaurants.<br/>Space- lots of room to spread out.<br/>Cleanliness- no issues.<br/>Amenities- WiFi, washer/dryer, dishwasher, TV.<br/>Host- Klara is great.  We were here to celebrate my mother-in-law's 70th and she brought her a present!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Location- Soho is loud<br/><br/>We would highly recommend staying here when in London.  "
3634802,215521077,2017-11-30,48773166,Vincent Dance Theatre,Great location and useful base for our performers whilst performing near Euston - just a short tube ride away. Would look to stay here again for future London visits
3634802,217897911,2017-12-10,76521712,Pedro,"Casa completa, totalmente recomendable. A 7 min de TODO el centro-centro. Si quieren estar cerca de todo, alquilen esta casa. El ruido que se menciona es el normal de la calle, no nos fue nada molesto en ningún caso."
3634802,218689781,2017-12-14,49936371,Derrick,"Superb location! The space was great for our large group. Conveniently located to everything. Clubs, shopping, theatre. Very clean and accommodating."
3634802,228144005,2018-01-18,83419893,George,"We had a great stay. The location is amazing, right on a cool little pedestrian lane with restaurants literally outside the door. David Bowie recorded a couple of albums a few doors down! <br/><br/>The townhouse was perfect for four of us, with two nice bedrooms with couches (one with its own big TV) and one okay bedroom. There is a very nice, big, updated, shared bathroom on the top floor.  The other bathroom is en suite with the least desirable bedroom on the middle floor and is honestly in need of a remodel, but nobody used it much.  There are pigeons that hang out at the back of the building and whoever is in that bedroom gets to hear them do that moaning thing. Fun for bird fanciers maybe;)<br/><br/>The living area is big and conducive to relaxing after a long day. A great place to stay in London for those who want to be in the center of the city with lots of stuff right there. Recommend the iconic Bar Italia nearby for coffee. The Italian guys there are hilarious and super cool. I would stay here again for sure."

The third ensuite bedroom was smaller than appeared in picture and we had some water leak issues from the bathroom above, but only when someone was showering."
3634802,241038164,2018-03-07,114991318,Carlos,Great apt distributed in 4 floors and very well located.
3634802,243793084,2018-03-17,159216649,Joycw,"Pros - The location can't be beat.  Close to numerous tube stations and a grocery store in next block.  So many restaurant/pub/bar/coffee/pastry shops within walking distance you will never go hungry or lack somewhere to go.   Can walk to many of the tourist sites. Was very clean and Tijana answered all our pretrip questions, which was a big help.<br/><br/>Home details that will help you decided if this is for you.  1st floor living areas.  2nd floor 2 bedrooms.  One large with TV, one smaller with attached bath.  You do need to walk thru that bedroom to get to bath.  3rd floor large bedroom with futon, large hallway bathroom.  The layout worked perfectly for a group of 6 adults.    <br/><br/>Con's people  have mentioned -noise. <br/>Well you are in a city! and in the  restaurant/nightlife area.  We had no issues, but being there in winter we had windows closed.  The apartment is on a street that is only foot traffic and no actual pubs, so if a large group walks home that way, I'm sure it can be nosy for a few minutes.   Honestly we had more trouble with the pigeon that liked to great the morning outside our window. (not exactly a land lord issue).  There are 3 flights of stairs, so if you have someone with mobility issues, this may not work for you."
3634802,249561930,2018-04-02,43809562,Francisco,"Casa muy amplia y excelentemente ubicada. En el corazón del Soho, los lugares centrales turísticos no están a más de 1 km de distancia. A metros de Oxford st y de cientos de pubs y bares. Gran atención de Tijana y Donna, quienes cumplieron con todas las espectativas. Éramos 4 personas pero es un lugar en donde entran cómodamente 5 o 6 más. Ampliamente recomendable para pasar unos días en Londres."
3634802,251583193,2018-04-08,54665661,Lorena,Great home in spectacular location. The kitchen is quite small but has everything. My family and I had a wonderful time in London!
3634802,254628740,2018-04-17,161044945,David,The location is amazing for experiencing Soho and the surrounding area. The communication before and during the trip was excellent. We had a few minor issues but I would expect them to be resolved before the next visitor. Overall great value.
3634802,257731738,2018-04-27,4047321,Valentine,"Très jolie petite maison au coeur de Soho, fonctionnelle et accueillante.<br/>La boulangerie Gail's au coin de la rue est très chaudement recommandée :)"
3634802,362394555,2018-12-26,137022487,Maricar,"Tijana's house is truly in the heart of Soho in Central London, which allowed my family to see so much of that charming area by foot."
3634802,406622400,2019-01-30,19409370,Mario,el Departamento esta excelente.  bien ubicado. Tijana esta todo el tiempo atenta al viajero.  tiene de todo lo que se necesita para cocinar. supermercado a 150 metros.  volvería sin dudar
3634802,412777255,2019-02-16,25386349,Emma Thrace,Just wanted to say how lovely this property is and how helpful Tijana and team are. They could not do enough for you. Many thanks for all your help
3634802,416865143,2019-02-25,166490195,Gabriel,Great location.   Lots or restaurants and shops nearby and all of the major tourists attractions are within walking distance.
3634802,435756503,2019-04-11,99845411,Pat,"Despite its good location (near Oxford st and Leicester Square), we had a terrible experience during our stay and the host did not try to solve them. <br/><br/>There was a water leakage from the bathroom on the top floor down to one of the bedrooms on the second floor. It was a very dangerous situation since the leak was near power outlets in the bedroom. We had to move the bed and unplugged all of the electric appliances in that bedroom. It happened since the first day of our stay and contacted the Host and they said they were going to send someone to have a look but never did. There is water stain on the wall in that bedroom which indicate that this was not a new issue and the host never tried to fix it properly.<br/><br/>There was no microwave provided during our first day which we really needed it to heat the baby food. We contacted the host and the first suggestion we received was ""try to use the oven instead"". Microwave was clearly in one of the photos but they said they took it out since there were some faults, which was fine but they should have provided a new one. Although they brought a new microwave on our second day after we insisted that we need it, the bad experience on the first day didn't help much.<br/><br/>It is not an easy place to find and you have to pick up the keys from the shop, which is located about 10-15 min walk. This means that you have to go the the shop first - not an easy option if you travel with a large family and many luggage, which was our case (8 family members). My family had to wait in the rain in front of the apartment while waiting for me to pick up the keys. The host suggested that we take a taxi to pick up the keys before going to the apartment but it was extremely difficult since there was no parking for taxis while waiting to pick up the keys.<br/><br/>We booked this place given the great reviews but I strongly suggest to avoid, especially if you travel with a big family. Given its expensive price, this place is not worth it at all."
3634802,446359848,2019-05-01,6820335,Olof,"Very well located place! Close to everything. Good restaurants near by. The place has everything you need. Not fancy but good! Tijana helped us out with the questions we had, very good. Over all a very well located and good place to stay."
3634802,457161762,2019-05-23,234858634,Kristen,"Cute, clean, comfy place close to bars, restaurants, shops &  public transport. Very accommodating to our large group of 6. Was very nice to have two restrooms to get ready in the morning  however there is only enough water pressure to run one shower at a time."
3634802,472342359,2019-06-19,50676260,Michael And Debbie,"This is a lovely property in an excellent location.  The apartment was clean and well appointed.  Tijana provided lots of useful information on transportation, activities, and nearby restaurants and shops.  We had a wonderful stay!"
3634802,507252823,2019-08-11,63311081,Joshua,"Absolutely fantastic location, bustling and loud but that is for sure part of the fun.  Everything is within minutes so walking and transport is a breeze.  The place is very large and has lots of room, however a word of caution on the stairs as others have pointed out.  The flat is spread over three stories so if your bags are heavy it will be a challenge.  I wouldn't let that stop you from staying here however, would certainly stay again."
3634802,522621684,2019-09-02,28257800,Melissa,"If location is your number one booking decision then book this spot. You can literally walk to many hot spots in London and it was great walking out our door to breakfast, lunch, dinner and hot nightlife. <br/><br/>That being said the furnishings are not as lux or updated as a flat this size would prob normally have for this area. Also we read reviews that there was not much toilet paper provided so we each packed a roll in my group of 3 ladies. We found there to be none when we got there...yikes, after 14 hours of travel you don’t want to run to a market to use the bathroom. <br/><br/>The kitchen is stocked well, enough plates and cutlery, but we did not cook. There was a little fridge, dishwasher and instant coffee and tea provided. <br/><br/>Last thing to note, you have to stop on the way to this location to get your keys at a 24 hour Convenience store. We had the host arrange our transport for pick up which was so lovely and helpful. BUT the driver was unaware of the needed stop then charged us additional money. Just make sure to be clear and arrange this yourself or with host. <br/><br/>If I were coming to London again I’d def stay here, but just want to keep others informed."
3634802,529818316,2019-09-15,237081629,Seamus,The location was perfect!
3634802,541492986,2019-10-05,21056298,Jose,"Tijana home is in a very convenient location with pubs, food and shopping minutes away along with a 5 min walk to the tube. The 3 bed are comfortable and provide everyone space to relax. The only consideration you must have is the loud outside noise and conversations throughout the night due to proximity of bars and SoHo trip."
3634802,551557499,2019-10-20,24646022,Elizaveta,"Excellent location  and nice place for group of people <br/>Apt is very updated, need some renovation"
3634802,553929248,2019-10-25,11522576,Sue,"Location is great, beds are comfortable and the space was good if you are travelling with a few people. However the negatives outweighed the good unfortunately. The location to pick up the key is an 8 minute walk - with luggage this is a pain. There are lots of stairs, you have to take your luggage up 3 steep and narrow flights of stairs to get to a bedroom and the main bathroom. The good location however means there is a lot of outside noise until the early hours of the morning. The blinds do not block out the lights from across the roads- so if you don’t have ear plugs or an eye shade you won’t get much sleep. Overall we liked the location but wouldn’t stay there again - too noisy, too many steps.. but the host was easy to deal with and provided lots of helpful info."
3634802,565278715,2019-11-17,32000024,Andreas,"The communication and the access  including getting the key etc. was flawless. The apartment itself though was hardly what we have expected. The pictures have been taken very well. So you get the impression that it is very spacious and modern. In fact only the top-floor bathroom was very nice. Since the apartment is located in  soho it is for sure good located, depending what you‘re looking for. The structure of the house though was very clairaudient because of the wooden floor. <br/>Furthermore there are maximum 3 suitable beds to sleep in, the rest was couches which are hardly offering a good night rest since the bed sheets are scarce goods too.<br/>Summarized I‘d say it is a good stay for younger people with less standards. For that though the price multiplies with the number of persons staying which makes it far to expensive from my point of view. You get a very decent hotel for the same amount of money.<br/>Sorry I couldn‘t give a better recession but this is honest.<br/><br/>Regards"

As can be expected by the location, it was somewhat loud during our Thursday-Sunday stay; therefore plan accordingly. For our group, it was perfect."
3634802,601357099,2020-02-03,10694380,Michael,"This is the second time I’ve stayed in this location and I can’t say enough good things about it!<br/><br/>If you’re going to London, I can’t think of a better place to stay!"

3997029,50399337,2015-10-11,45522977,Waleed,Charles waited for us until we were ready to pick up the key and didn't try to rush us. He gave us a full tour of the area when we arrived and took genuine interest in why we were staying. He was a very kind and attentive host.<br/><br/>The location is spot on if you want the xcell. It's just five minutes away. Plus there's a tesco and several cafes all within a couple of minutes
3997029,52770210,2015-11-01,47001738,Ciara,"We stayed at Charles apartment for 2 nights, it's exactly as described. Good location as right near the DLR with a small Tesco around the back of the building. Would definitely recommend. "

Little Tesco round the corner for some food shopping and we dined at Top 1 Forever on the corner of the plaza. It's a steakhouse but has some good veggie options. The Emirates Airline is worth going on, brilliant view of London on a clear day.<br/><br/>The apartment was clean, tidy and had everything we needed. A lovely place. Def use it again if I come back to London. "
4210429,21321075,2014-10-14,16424793,Mackenzie,"What can I say about this apartment other than its absolutely gorgeous?<br/>Hmm...<br/>We truly enjoyed our stay at Anna's flat! The bedroom was clean clean clean and the bed was beyond comfortable. Tearing ourselves out of bed at 8 in the morning was quite a task! The flat is located not too far from the center, which allowed us to pop over to Mile End and take the central line into town with no problems. Walking back after midnight each night, we felt completely safe as everything was perfectly lit. <br/>While Anna wasn't able to welcome us (we weren't the only ones on vacation!) she gave easy directions to her office where we were greeted by one of her colleagues who was all too happy to give us tube directions to the flat. I would recommend not walking from Kings cross to the office if you have luggage (we were stubborn and thought we would be fine) as its a little further than it appears on the map.<br/>We were, however, welcomed by the fresh brownies that Anna laid out for us :) Communication leading up to our stay was incredibly easy and Anna made a point of responding quickly and fully addressing any questions I had posed. This is not the case with all AirBnB hosts, so it was certainly refreshing not having to wait several hours (or a day!) to receive answers to semi-important questions. <br/>Overall, we had a great visit and would definitely recommend this listing.

Before I got there, the communication was very good and Paul kindly texted me directions so it was very easy to find the flat.<br/>Paul & Emma's place is fantastic and very well located, close to Highbury & Islington station and Upper Street, near some of the best restaurants and bars in London. <br/>The room was perfect, very cute, peaceful and had everything   l needed, including a great bed with lovely bedding, a wardrobe and a table. <br/>The whole flat is lovely, warm, clean and colourful, with a friendly atmosphere. Paul and Emma are great hosts and a very sweet couple, I felt very comfortable with them. They gave me great tips about where to find places in the area and also shared with me lots of useful knowledge about healthy living and eating. <br/>Highbury Fields Park is nearby too and I was able to go for my usual morning jog. All in all, a lovely place and I am looking forward to coming back soon. This is my new home in North London:).<br/>"
4612667,24678641,2015-01-01,23559863,Emily,"Paul was very kind and the listing is as described; the neighborhood safe as I ran each morning and incredibly close to the tube station. Very easy to find. Everything was great, Paul had towels for us and fresh flowers, the room was lovely... But we did have a slight mix up with the keys. We were accidentally given keys to the wrong building and were locked out of the building for about an hour one night around 11pm until we finally got a neighbor to buzz us in. We could not get in touch with Paul until the following morning. That said, everything was settled the following day and we were given the correct set of keys. But we were locked out and unable to reach him. But overall, pleasant stay!"
4612667,24873375,2015-01-03,7182186,Eleanor,"Paul was a warm and welcoming host, very cool and laid back. When we arrived, he made us tea and told us about the neighbourhood, and recommended where to find dinner. The room is very nice, and the apartment is extremely well located. I had never been to Islington, but it is a charming place with lots of good food places. Two minute walk to the tube station, and then you're quickly into the centre of London. Thanks for everything, Paul!"

It's clean, comfortable and quiet. <br/><br/>Islington is a cool area, and we were spoilt for choice with lots of places to eat and drink. <br/><br/>Paul is an excellent host, easy to communicate with and chat to - he welcomed us with tea and cake!

They keep the house very clean and generally have a very soulful vibe in the house. The location is perfect very close to the bustling Upper street with a choice of bars, restaurants and cuisines. Also close to multiple convenience stores. At the same time the apartment is tucked away in a quite lane for those who like their silence. I highly recommend this apartment and location. "

4612667,28249533,2015-03-21,8818388,Joanna,"Paul and Emma were very welcoming hosts, and their home is a very calm and relaxing place to stay. We stayed for 2 nights and were out for most of the time exploring the local area and coming back to their street was like stepping out of London into a quiet tree lined avenue, peace and quiet away from the hustle and bustle. The room was light and airy with a very comfortable bed.<br/>As we left my mum was saying that she would like to come back with my dad next time so you may see us both again Paul! Thanks for making our first airbnb experience so positive."

He also left us clean towels and water. The room was just as described, clean and homely. The location was perfect for Highbury/Islington tube and overground and there are a wide choice of bars and places to eat on Upper Street just 3 minutes walk away. Notwithstanding the location, the flat was quite quiet throughout the night."
4612667,36885830,2015-07-02,34583175,Sebastian,"I can't imagine a better host for Airbnb first-timer like me. Paul and Emma were very welcoming and provided us everything we needed for our one month stay. The flat was tidy and had that unique feel of overall happiness. The neighbourhood was quiet, with a lot of trees and parks nearby but at the same time very close to the lively main streets. Thank you for the great time with had!"

The location is great being close to Highbury & Islington station for the tube and overground, and close to Upper Street, Islington for its shops, bars and restaurants."
4612667,40054198,2015-07-27,39317347,Daliso,Paul was fantastic and made us feel comfortable immediately. We could make drinks and the room was clean with lovely fresh flowers which was fab. For me the bed was too hard but that's a preference I don't share with many of my friends so don't take my work for it. The place and area was quiet and if I ever need a weekend in London I will be booking with Paul if he will have us bk. <br/><br/>Thanks Paul. 
4612667,41607290,2015-08-08,623710,Thea,Paul was a friendly host who was very welcoming when we arrived at his home.  The room was light and spacious with everything we needed.

Thanks Paul for making us feel very much at home!
4612667,44814680,2015-08-29,36745031,Preeti,"Paul and Emma were wonderful hosts. It was my first air bnb experience and they really made it a very welcoming stay. The room was clean and Emma had left some beautiful flowers and a bottle of water in my room which was very thoughtful. The flat itself had a very  tranquil and calm atmosphere like a little sanctuary in central London. Emma and Paul are very keen on yoga and meditation and I think that reflects their flat nicely which is what I loved about it. It had a real a positive energy. I was also able to use the kitchen facilities to cook if necessary. The location was great, so close to highbury and islington tube station. Paul was funny and easy going and Emma was really sweet. They respected privacy but also were  really easy to talk to and chat with. I have to say their positive energy has definitely inspired me to learn a thing or two. <br/>If I ever need a place to stay for a while I know where to come in London! "
4612667,47124542,2015-09-15,37954078,Jonathan,"Finding the flat was a breeze, literally 4-5 mins walk from Highbury & Islington tube station. Flat is located in a lovely quiet tree-lined street in a nice neighbourhood. Paul was very welcoming and sincere and we appreciated the fresh flowers on the table as well as bottles of mineral water. The flat is spotless and very warm and cosy, and has a nice feel and energy to it. We really enjoyed our time there, and its sooo convenient to go to central london. 1 stop to king's cross, and 3 stops to oxford circus (!!!)"

The whole property was really clean. It is as described, quiet, great neighbourhood and the station is only minutes away. They left me a fresh flower and bottles of water. Furthermore, they helped me to get around London, his son even lent me his Oyster card when I haven't had one. Paul and his son also helped me took up and down the stairs my heavy luggage. Really the 3 of them are very sincere nice people, I had a great time. Thank you."
4612667,49248079,2015-10-02,26607837,Jake,"Paul is a fantasitc host. Chatting with him was always happy, which also made me feel welcome. The location is excellently being close to Highbury & Islington station for the tube and Emirate Stadium. A very good choice for Arsenal fans. The room is cozy and clean, where you were so close to the nature while the top of tree was hand-reachable and birds' songs were waking me up every morning!"
4612667,49383019,2015-10-03,207591,Gaelle,Paul's place was very clean and well located. I didn't get the chance to meet Paul but his wife was very welcoming. I would recommend the place and would definitely stay again if needed.

The room was clean, tidy and super spacious and Paul made us feel very welcome throughout our stay. The location is amazing - only a short walk from the Islington & Highbury underground station and various bus stops. Many excellent restaurants are close by on lively Upper Street, along which one can comfortably stroll to the busy eateries and bars around Angel station. Nevertheless, the flat is tucked away in a tranquil residential street, so noise was never an issue. Would definitely stay again."

The room was spacious and thoughtfully decorated (loved the fresh flowers). It has a table, which came in handy as I was in London for a course and had to do some studying. There is a very nice atmosphere in the flat and both bathroom and kitchen are clean. <br/>It is close to Highbury and Islington station and the Victoria line will take you straight into town. There are also lots of restaurants nearby and two supermarkets too.<br/>Communication with both Paul and Emma went very smoothly and was very pleasant. All in all a very good Airbnb experience!"
4612667,105268047,2016-10-01,6121805,Talina,"Paul was a fantastic host. We stayed in his airbnb for one month and had a great stay. We were able to use the kitchen, and do laundry. The room is very comfortable, with a wardrobe, mirror, and small table & chairs included. He even provided us with a laundry rack! The room is a bit noisy as it faces the street but with the windows closed there was no issue at all. Location is great, just minutes from Upper Street.

Da vi kom ble vi møtt av sønnen i huset som fortalte oss alt vi trengte å vite i tillegg til å anbefale oss hvor vi kunne få kjøpt oss middag i nærområdet. Pauls leilighet ligger veldig fint til i forhold til offentlig transport, med King Cross kun et stopp unna med undergrunnen. Rommet var rent og pent og mer en stort nok for oss to. Til tross for at vi var mye og dermed ikke så så mye til Paul fikk vi inntrykk av at det bare var å si ifra om vi trengte noe. <br/>Kort oppsummert var rommet veldig fint og vi kan anbefale det på det sterkeste uten noe å klage på!"

The room is quite nice--bright and airy with the windows open.<br/><br/>I never met Paul, but his partner, and especially his son, were nice.<br/><br/>A couple things to note: The bed is actually a futon and very low to the floor, which could be a problem if you have bad knees or other mobility problems. (It also has a pretty thin mattress.) Some of the little touches you might be used to from other airbnb stays weren't there: a hair dryer, toiletries, light breakfast snacks, nice towels. (There were towels, they were just pretty thin.) Which is fine as long as you know and come prepared."

Bed is comfortable, there is also a big table and a wardrobe. When we arrived room was fully ready for us and we even got complementary Indian sweets which my husband liked a lot. Heating was turned on most of the time, so it was very warm inside plus we had additional radiator in the room. Locatation of the flat is truly great, 4 stops from Oxford circus. The area itself is very nice you can walk to Angel tube station and see lots of cafes, restaurants and designer shops around."

Elle a eue un week end chargé et nous aussi donc nous ne nous sommes pas beaucoup vus mais elle nous a fait visiter l'appartement afin qu'on s'y sente bien. <br/>Appartement fidèle aux photos, très propre et agréable à vivre. Chambre un peu bruyante mais avec la fenêtre fermée ça va (sauf pour la chaleur mais ouf!, on avait un ventilateur). Très bien situé, à proximité du centre ville et donc bien desservi."
5026463,39094195,2015-07-20,38056606,Meghan,"Charlotte is a very sweet, helpful girl. I thank her for allowing me full access to the printer and washing machine — 2 things travelers rarely can plan on seeing with ease. The apartment living areas, room and bathroom were all lived in but very clean. I was surprised to find this room isn't a spare, so I felt bad at first when she slept on the couch, but she didn't seem to mind the arrangement and stayed out of the space and let me keep my privacy when it was rented to me. The apartment is across the street from a big bus hub/underground, only about 1.3 mile walk to Westminster Abbey, Parliment, Big Ben and more. The Victoria Coach bus station is also only 1.2 miles which proved to be invaluable as I ended up on the National Express both to and from Stansted. I walked nearly everywhere my 3 days in London and didn't feel unsafe returning to the her apartment area at night. Thanks for your assistance with everything Charlotte. "

5026463,124632016,2017-01-02,98868037,Alvin,The apartment is clean and nicely arranged.   Good location as very closed to Underground/Bus Hub.  Even it just take 5min walk to Vauxhall bridge then will be able to see New year eve fireworks from far.

I will be always making this my first choice for my next london visit. 10/10"
5049699,29324088,2015-04-06,29214195,Tony,"A perfect cozy apartment in the perfect location. I rented Jaqualines apartment for myself and my girlfriend for a couple of days getaway into London and it was just great. We were met by Jaqualines sister as Jaqualine was busy but she made us feel completely welcome and showed us round the apartment. She even bought us eggs, milk, bread , juice and some easter eggs :) The apartment was clean and tidy, lovely and warm due to the underfloor heating system and I loved the balcony to the front overlooking Fulham Broadway. I will definitely be using it again next time we want to stay in London. Thank you Jaqualine."
5049699,30469229,2015-04-22,25293354,Jo,"Jacqueline was such a fantastic host, everything describe in this apartment was absolutely beautiful we enjoyed every minute close to the tube and central to get to anywhere. Loved our stay here and it does make it easier when your host makes everything easy and relaxed. Once again I would recommend this apartment to anyone. "
5049699,30815886,2015-04-27,24896553,Jennifer,"Jacqualine's Flat could not have been more perfect!! She was extremely responsive and it was lovely to meet her when I arrived. The Flat was so nice that you almost did not want to leave but when you do, the convenience of the location to great pubs, restaurants and transportation could not be beat!! Thank you!<br/>"
5049699,31336755,2015-05-04,23471646,Thomas,"Jacqueline was a great host. She met us upon arrival and made sure we were settled in, comfortable with transport and even recommended good places to see in the local area. She has a modern flat that is in an amazing location, right next to a main subway station. Fulham is a great suburb to be situated in as there was a great Vibe there with great places to eat at and visit. We had a thoroughly enjoyable time!  "
5049699,32116590,2015-05-14,29403903,Randall,"Jacqualine met us at the flat with a bouquet of flowers, truffles and champagne to commemorate our 47th wedding anniversary, and our refrigerator was stocked with basic breakfast foods: eggs, bread and butter for toast, juice and milk. After patiently instructing us on security measures and use of the flat’s appliances, she was on her way, leaving us information on where to reach her in the event of questions or emergencies. <br/>The airbnb description of the flat was accurate. It was small and spartan, but it met all of our needs, with ready access to shops, markets, and Starbucks, and only a five minute walk from our door to the London metro, a godsend after dawn-to-dusk sight-seeing and touring. <br/><br/>The Chelsea neighborhood was safe, colorful and vibrant, only a few blocks from the stadium and surrounded by lively local pubs that rocked and shouted on game day. If you want to experience daily life in a flat in the heart of English footballdom, we highly recommend this listing.<br/>"
5049699,35553213,2015-06-20,27895335,Liliana,"Jacqualine,the host was very friendly and helpful. The communication was clear and smooth. The place itself ideal for couples, who want to spend romantic time together. My partner and I loved the fact that our favourite grocery store-Whole Foods was located on the other side of the street! Pretty much, we had everything on our door step! <br/> Thank you Jacqueline! We had truly fabulous time!"
5049699,36110203,2015-06-25,895127,Leonid,A nice flat and a very accommodating host. We enjoyed our time in the True Blue neighborhood.
5049699,37044805,2015-07-04,15743866,Jack,Apartment was in a great location and all amenities were superb

5049699,45587809,2015-09-04,31254753,Kim,"What a perfectly situated and apportioned apartment right in the centre of everything you need in Fulham! I had the best stay in the apartment, was greeted and shown around so well and just found everything easy and organised for a quick few nights stay. Jacqualine even arranged bread, milk, jam and juice for me which I think was just going that extra mile and totally unnecessary but so appreciated!"
5049699,46622851,2015-09-12,41657525,Carol,"My husband and I visited London for the very first (but not the last) time and stayed in this beautiful, comfortable flat.  We immediately felt at home and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Jacqualine was a fabulous host and quickly oriented us to both the apartment and the neighborhood.  Thank you for making our first trip to London so special.  We will be back again!"
5049699,47627028,2015-09-21,31757326,Jennifer,"The flat was very nice and clean, exactly what I expected from the pictures. Jacqualine wasn't able to greet us, but her husband did and he showed us around the apartment, and there was a little booklet of info for us too. They even had some breakfast food for us, which after a long flight was really great. <br/><br/>The bed was comfortable, the shower was nice and the bathroom has lots of space. <br/><br/>The neighbourhood had everything. There were lots of pubs, restaurants, and shops. And it was a minute to the tube, which was so convenient. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend it and would stay again! "
5049699,49349890,2015-10-03,43277796,Richard,"The flat is the perfect size for a couple and has all the amenities one could ever need. The top floor location provides good views of the neighborhood and helps reduce the noise level from the street, which can be particularly loud at commute times (buses, motorcycles, and emergency vehicles) and Friday and Saturday evenings (party!!). On the other hand, it's the hustle and bustle of the Fulham Broadway location that makes the flat such a great place to stay. (Besides, there's always time to sleep at work when your vacation is over.) The area has many great restaurants, pubs, and shops and is within 100 yards of several bus stops and Fulham Broadway tube station (and within stumbling distance of Stamford Bridge if you're a Chelsea FC fan).<br/><br/>Jaqualine (the owner) was kind enough to meet my wife and I when we arrived (even though we were delayed) and give us a quick intro to the flat. She even left us a bottle of champagne to recognize our 25th anniversary.<br/><br/>We highly recommend Jaqualine's flat."
5049699,50439031,2015-10-12,38105214,Shergul,"Fantastic! Sleek and modern and perfect for a couple. Location is great, lots of restaurants and bars. And proximity to Chelsea Football Club great! Highly endorse"
5049699,52718995,2015-11-01,43604274,Julia,"Jacqualineʻs flat was perfect! This was my first time using Airbnb-- I searched hundreds of listings until I came across this flat. I stayed here for 3 weeks as I was attending the Rugby World Cup for the knock out stages. <br/><br/>From the moment we made contact via Airbnb, Jacqualine was as accommodating and as gracious as a host could get. I knew that before I even arrived in England that I had made the right decision. Her flat felt like home. Jacqualine checked in a couple times during my stay and always responded promptly when I had questions.<br/><br/>Upon arrival, Jacqualine welcomed us with open arms. The flat was beautiful! Exactly what it looked like in the pictures and the balcony makes it even better! She even left some essentials in the fridge to help us get on our feet after the long travel. <br/><br/>The neighborhood is perfect. Tons of restaurants, grocery stores (Whole Foods was a huge plus for us since my mom has dietary restrictions), and just the right amount of nightlife if you want it. The Underground is a 2 minute walk away and the attendants that work there are extremely helpful and kind. Traveling into Central London felt like it took no time at all. Fulham is a great, safe area to be in. Itʻs a happening place but itʻs also removed from the hustle and bustle of the big city.<br/><br/>I would absolutely recommend this flat! I would definitely love to stay here again when I return. "
5049699,53894721,2015-11-14,39667755,Humza,This was our first Airbnb Experience can't say anything wrong with this place! Amazing location literally a 2 minute walk from Fulham Broadway. Wholefoods boots and everything right in the vicinity. Jacqualine was an amazing host who took care of all our needs made sure we arrived safe and threw out was an amazing host. She even had the fridge stocked up. It was very nice of her! After a long journey it was needed. Will for sure visit this beautiful flat again. Amazing location. Nice view from the balcony and overall and amazing experience! Jacqualine answered all questions and made our time as smooth as possible! Highly recommended!
5049699,55656146,2015-12-04,42355054,Mandy,"I was delighted with the communication I had with Jacqualine right from the beginning till the end of our stay a delightful lady to deal with.  On arrival we were met by Jacqualine's lovely husband who had patiently waited for us due to a long flight delay and even though we had held him up he stayed for a chat, a very lovely man !   The flat was exactly as It had been listed but even more beautiful.  Jacqualine had  stocked the cupboards with essentials such as eggs, bread, milk margarine, tea, coffee, spreads with chocolates by the bed and there was even a beautiful vase of flowers on the table, this was not what I had expected but was oh so appreciated as the last thing I wanted to do after a 25 hour plane trip was to go shopping.  The flat is so convenient to public transport with both trains and buses at your doorstep.  The shops, bars and restaurants are all at your doorstep but as far as noise goes with the flat being on the top floor you would hardly know they where there.  There is a community street market with fresh produce  everyday just around the corner and the wonderful Wholefoods store is directly opposite.  There is even a gorgeous little Church bazaar also just up the street to browse through a few times a week.   I would not hesitate in the slightest to return to Jacqualine's flat, I couldn't have been more delighted with the entire experience and I highly recommend a stay.    Thankyou so much Jacqualine."
5049699,56312926,2015-12-12,47836844,Stephen,"Perfect visit, right from the start! It's a very easy place to find, the instructions are simple and clear. The fridge was stocked with a few essentials to help me get started which was a nice touch. Jacqualine gave me a quick tour to show how everything worked and my week went by with no issues at all. The appartment is very comfortable with everything you could need.<br/><br/>The location is great, only a couple of minutes from the tube and with many food shops/takeaways/restaurants in the area.<br/><br/>Overall 10/10, I would have no hesitation staying here again on my next visit to London."
5049699,66142935,2016-03-20,42481996,Kevin,"Jacqualine's flat is superbly appointed and in the HEART of it all in Fulham. If you are going to a match at Stamford Bridge you literally can NOT ask for a better location. It is a 30 sec walk (WITH BAGS) from the front of the Tube station and just a 1 minute walk to the stadium. There's a Whole Foods across the street in case your stay is long enough to warrant going for groceries (and you're looking for all-organic and locally sourced stuff) and a Sainsbury's inside the Tube station (in case you're looking for regular groceries and foods). Pubs EVERYWHERE, restaurants and an electric atmosphere all around! The flat is situated on the top floor, which is a little rough with the stairs to get up there, but means it also has 2 patio decks! The first is outside the main room and kitchen and looks over Fulham road and the second is off the bedroom overlooking the neighborhood behind it. The place is very modern, but also very homey - and it's difficult to see in the pix, but has about the most comfortable giant purple comfy couch I've ever been on! This place is seriously great!"
5049699,66947090,2016-03-25,40870750,Melissa,"Jacqualine couldn't meet me herself but had her very nice neighbors meet me and had the flat stocked with a few things for breakfast, shampoo, and other thoughtful touches - so lovely! There was a pamphlet with all the info you need.  The flat is in the heart of Fulham Broadway. So convenient to everywhere.  There is lots of traffic noise in the living room but in the bedroom with the door closed I found it very quiet.  The flat was modern and clean and had everything you would need.  Jacqualine is super responsive, flexible and helpful. Great experience!"
5049699,70078523,2016-04-16,9913725,Emy,"I was met at the flat by one of Jacqueline's friends who was very nice; he even helped carry my luggage upstairs.<br/><br/>The flat is really lovely, clean, modern and cosy and very conveniently located - 30 second walk from the tube station and bus stops.<br/><br/>Jacqualine stocked the fridge with essentials like orange juice, milk, eggs and there was a fresh loaf of bread as well - really thoughtful.<br/><br/>The bed was comfortable, the bedding was warm & soft, the towels were big & fluffy and the underfloor heating was nice & toasty. <br/><br/>The iron wasn't functioning properly so after I messaged Jacqueline to let her know, she arranged for a new iron to be dropped off by her husband. <br/><br/>I had a great time and felt at home in the flat!"
5049699,73126383,2016-05-07,49629355,Jamie,"Staying at Jacqualine's was a dream first time using Airbnb. From before we even arrived she was so helpful, accommodating and kind to us. when we arrived she had wine and 2 glasses set out for us and things to get us started in the fridge. The flat itself was beautiful and clean and we *loved* the location -- so nice to be THAT close to the underground station, Whole Foods and many of restaurants. We truly felt like it was home for the week we were there and I didn't want to leave. I was nervous about trying Airbnb for the first time and we definitely picked the right place to stay with how great this flat was and how at ease Jacqualine made us feel."
5049699,74057055,2016-05-12,62040934,Sean,"Jaqualine was a wonderful host and made us feel very welcome. The flat was perfect for our needs and very well situated, literally doors from the tube station. We would definitely stay there again!"
5049699,75085653,2016-05-18,56909240,Rob,"Jacqueline was a fantastic host!  Aside from being met at the flat with keys and a quick run down on how things worked through out the place, there were suggestions for restaurants within the area and things to do throughout the day.  There was more than enough room for my wife and I to feel very comfortable and not cramped in the flat.  There was a nice little table outside on the balcony where we were able to enjoy the evening and feel right at home!  In short, it was perfect!"
5049699,82850113,2016-06-29,27875131,Alex,"Jacqualine was super friendly and made herself available at all times. This was my first Airbnb experience and it was an incredibly positive one. Essentials were stocked in the fridge upon arrival (eggs, juice, etc)- such a nice touch given that I had taken a long haul flight to get there. The bottle of wine did not hurt either! The area is extremely clean and perfect for one person- it would fit comfortably for two as well. The balcony in the sitting area is spacious and offers great views across Fulham Broadway. <br/>Towels, toiletries, all stocked and supplied including a fan- perfect for the summer months. I would recommend this flat to anyone! <br/>It is set on the top floor with no lift, but the stairway is adequately wide and won't be a problem for most people. I appreciated the first set of main doors before the doors to the flat because that offers an extra level of safety/privacy as well. <br/>"
5049699,107370139,2016-10-10,92879579,Marilyn,"Thank you Jacqualine for making our first experience with airbnb and in London so amazing.  This home away from home was perfect for us!  Easy to find and a great location in London on the Direct Line.  Close to some great restaurants and shopping too.  Jacqualine greeted us with a real welcome, showed us around the place, gave us a few pointers and then left us to enjoy and explore London.  Jacqualine very generously stocked the fridge with a few essentials and even chocolates by the bedside.  She left us her contact number in case we had any troubles but we were fine!  The bed was very very comfortable!"
5049699,109112125,2016-10-19,19106698,Cristiane,"Jacqualine was a great host. She met us at the flat and introduced the place. She made us feel very welcome and let herself available for anything we needed during our stay. She even stocked the fridge with some nice essentials.<br/><br/>This amazing flat is really fully equipped, very cozy and clean. Being just a few steps away from Fulham Broadway station makes your stay at this apartment very convenient - from District line you can easily come and go around London. The location in a busy area is a great advantage: there are many pubs, restaurants and cafes around, and a WholeFoods just across the street. But it can get a little noisy (particularly at weekend nights), so keep it in mind if you have a light sleep. <br/><br/>The experience overall was great and I would highly recommend staying there!"
5049699,114787041,2016-11-20,8297106,Kornelia,"The apartment is amazing and Jacqualine is a perfect host! have not met personally but she was always very fast to respond to any questions. The apartment is nicely furnished and very well equipped. It is located over a bar though so consider that noise may bother you on Friday and Saturday. Still, I had a very nice time!"
5049699,116321446,2016-11-29,27919813,Luba,"Everything before the arrival, during our staying at the apartment as well as after our departure went perfectly well. The communication was prompt and smooth. The apartment is perfectly situated near to a supermarket and the underground station Fulham broadway and is fully equipment with everything a tourist might need in the kitchen, bathroom or bedroom. Upon our arrival we discovered that the fridge was filled with enough stuff for us to have our first breakfast in London - we felt welcome (and full :-)). The bed is comfortable, the kitchen and bathroom clean. We had great 4 days in London!"
5049699,120903037,2016-12-12,101632501,Ari,Amazing and extremely comfortable stay. Jacqui is really helpful and responsive at all times. Will definitely be visiting again soon! highly recommended!

5049699,151522893,2017-05-13,1139870,Ellen,"Jacqualine's place was perfect for our needs.  The neighborhood is fun, surrounded by stores, restaurants, the Chelsea football stadium and close to everything.  It's closeness to the tube was great, enabling us to go wherever we wanted in a short amount of time.  The flat had all the amenities we needed and Jacqualine provided us with breakfast items, coffee, tea, and a bottle of wine.  The queen bed in the bedroom was comfortable and the room away from the front road so it was very quiet and with the drapes pulled, very dark should you want to sleep in.  Jacqueline was also extremely accommodating, meeting us at 9 in the morning to check us in early after our flight arrived from Heathrow.  She also let us stay until we needed to leave for the airport which we truly appreciated.  The wi-fi worked great and the bathroom while cosy was clean and useful.<br/><br/>Overall, we would highly recommend Jacqueline's flat and she was a great host!"

5049699,160691237,2017-06-15,48832451,Caroline,This is an exceptional pied a terre in a great location.  The bedroom is very quiet considering the location...bang on Fulham Broadway!  It has two balconies which make it feel light and more spacious.  It was great for me as I was in town on business and needed to be close to public transport.  <br/>I would heartily recommend this apartment for both business and leisure.  
5049699,165157553,2017-06-30,105747866,Karl,The property was excellent!  It was close to the underground and was exactly what we were looking for.

5049699,320226618,2018-09-08,58094377,Jane,"Very cute modern apartment in a fantastic location, in the heart of vibrant Fulham. Perfect for two people. Apt has a secure entry and it is only a short walk to the station. Wholefoods is just down the road as well as many cafes etc. The hosts also provided some essentials for our arrival (milk, bread, juice etc) which was very thoughtful. Bed was comfy and linen and towels of good quality.  The apartment is up a few flights of stairs - something to be aware of if you have heavy suitcases - but that wasn't an issue for us. Really enjoyed staying here and would highly recommend."

Would 100% recommend this space to anyone who is looking for a great & local location in London!"

5049699,563564938,2019-11-13,157014017,Peter,"For starters Jacqueline's husband Guy, met me at the flat at 10:00am for an earlier checkin than I anticipated. That was greatly appreciated because I was able to sort my luggage and immediately start taking in the sights. There were a few bits and pieces that he made sure was there upon my arrival to get me going ( e.g. milk, bread, butter eggs, tea, and orange, juice.) Guy also spent a few moments talking to me about some of the local restaurants in the area and told me where to head to find a few local ""greasy spoons."" I very well could have spent my entire stay within a few blocks of the flat and not once found myself threatened with boredom. The flat is also just a minute or two walk to the Fulham Broadway Underground which grants quick access to wherever your aiming to venture and tour. For me the terraces and the close walking distance to Stamford Bridge were the cherry on top. The flat itself was very clean, extremely cozy, and very modern. It has everything you need throughout the duration of your stay. This was my first time booking an Airbnb outside of the states. It was the best experience I've had; which I've had plenty of great experiences on this side of the pond. Whether you are looking for food, football, shopping, cocktails, or dining; do yourself a favor and consider booking your stay here. It truly is a fantastic flat!"
5049699,608716273,2020-02-21,39215178,Kajsa,Great stay in an amazing apartment in Fulham. <br/>Great communication with the host and the apartment was really nice.

I was left in the lurch last minute with a week between flats so being able to instantly book a room was a life saver. Being between flats, I had all my belongings with me spread over several suitcases, which Chrystelle was kind enough to help carry up to my room.<br/>The location is ideal because it's away from noisy central streets but mere minutes from the main bus routes to Streatham/Clapham/etc<br/>The room is exactly as pictured and the bed is an absolute dream to sleep on!<br/>The rest of the house reminds me of a country family home, lots of wooden features and little decorations, notes to and from the children, pictures on the fridge, like a home away from home.<br/>I didn't see much of the family as I was out early for work each day and not back until late most nights. When I did have the chance it was lovely to stop and chat"

The bathroom is on the same floor and we did not mind as the family left in the early morning.<br/>Chrystelle is very kind and always smiling. Listening in evening over tea. The atmosphere in the house is warm and their children are discrete and very polite.<br/>The area is quiet (pavilion area) and located near a park. The tube is about fifteen minutes on foot or faster by bus (3 lines) with all amenities.<br/>To conclude, it feels like home in a family!"

The bedrooms are comfortable with quality beds and well-appointed bathrooms.<br/> <br/>VanZyl and his team took care all of our needs and could give us lots of helpful hints about the amenities in the area.
6181613,645178222,2020-08-01,122542916,Jane,"The apartment was gorgeous, and the roof terrace perfect for the summer. Best location possible, right by the park, Whole Foods and the Tube."
6350888,32439952,2015-05-17,33390728,Katie,Eileen's house was a great place to stay! It was an easy walk from the Underground station and she had great tips for not only places to see in London but also which subway stations were closed. She also has some pretty friendly pets. Would definitely recommend to stay with. 
6350888,34734229,2015-06-11,34024016,Fabrizio,I provided accomodation for my mother visiting me in London.<br/>Eileen was really kind and supportive.<br/>If you're looking for a quite place it is definitely recommended.
6350888,40600546,2015-08-01,31227731,Faith,Made very welcome even though Eileen wasn't there. Nice room and advert was accurate. I was able to come and go as I pleased.<br/>Easy access to the tube.<br/>I enjoyed my stay a lot. 
6350888,41863849,2015-08-09,40008746,Jacky,"From the beginning Eileen was very kind and helpful. She picked me up at a tube station. She knows all the tips and tricks, you only need to ask it. I enjoyed the time that I have been there. "
6350888,42085967,2015-08-10,33950478,Deangela,I never got to arrive at Eileen's house because my flight had complications. Even though Eileen was super helpful and concerned about my wellbeing. She was the only one willing to take me in so late because my flight was going to be come in past midnight. I recommend her to anybody.
6350888,43694855,2015-08-21,40785762,Ed,"LOOK NO FURTHER! Eileen is an amazing landlady, who would truly go the extra mile and turn your stay into a rewarding experience. <br/><br/>Location is great, no more than 10 minutes walk to THREE underground stations, house is great and the pets are amazing.<br/><br/>HIGHLY recommend!<br/><br/>Thank you Eileen."
6350888,44771721,2015-08-29,31227731,Faith,Another great stay! Elaine was fantastic; picking up my luggage and dropping me at the station at an ungodly hour of the morning!<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend! Elaine is so kind and made me feel right at home. She is very supportive and we had a great laugh!
6350888,45977039,2015-09-07,37545876,Tang-Cheng,Eileen is so kind and nice and her house is so comfortable to stay and the neighborhood is quiet and clam. I sincerely recommend her house to everyone who would like to stay in London. 
6350888,47909288,2015-09-21,25549061,Michał,I've stayed at Eileen's for three nights to have time to sort my life out after returning from a long holiday. Everything went smoothly and the stay was a true pleasure. The place was very cosy and had a homely atmosphere with all the essentials provided. Eileen made an impression of a very friendly lady having a sense of humour not without a spicy touch of irony. ;) I was made to feel at home and managed to sort out what I needed with good zone 4 connections to central London.
6350888,50346237,2015-10-11,703848,Philippe,"Superbe maison et une hôte aux petits soins. C'était comme si Eileen fut une amie de longue date, un séjour vraiment chaleureux.<br/><br/>Beautiful house and Eileen was such a perfect host. I thought we were like old friends, a very relaxing stay."

6350888,53961179,2015-11-15,42538973,Ching Kit,Very nice and warm place to live with love and care. Eileen is like my elder sister who even taught me how to cook and find jobs in London. Thanks to her advice I am going to start a new page for my UK working-holiday adventure.<br/> Cheers(≧∇≦)
6350888,56536994,2015-12-14,38422170,Jan,"Eileen was a very friendly and helpful host who also had some very interesting discussions about different things such as politics with me.<br/>My room was of a good size, the house is clean and quite. <br/>I would recommend Eileens home to everybody who wants to travel to London regardless of his or her purpose (holiday, work...).<br/>I would come again if I went to London another time!<br/><br/>Thank you Eileen!"
6350888,59934496,2016-01-17,52007998,Eugénie,"Eileen has a nice home and is very nice and supportive.<br/>The place is calm and secure with transport facilities (buses, tube stations)."
6350888,60345626,2016-01-22,27882292,Duncan,I was made to feel very welcome and the listing was accurate. I would have no hesitation about staying there again. Many thanks Eileen.
6350888,64038469,2016-02-29,33527365,Ronald,"She walked from her house to meet me as I walked frimthe tube station.  The area is quiet and typical of other areas, small houses with no side yards.  A few minutes walk away were lots if neat little neighborhood shops.  We had some great conversations.  She even drove me to a different tube station so I would not be late for an appointment.  She was very helpful with suggestions of where to go for what I was looking for.  The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of closet space for me.  I travel only with carry-ons.  I don't have much.  The bathroom, kitchen, and living toolsets pleasant to be in.  I even got to dry my clothes outside on a clothes line!<br/>I really enjoyed my stay with Eileen."
6350888,65371097,2016-03-13,5462484,Aisyah,"I had a really good time staying at Eileen place. My flight schedule was  unlikely..but she was understanding about it. Her house is lovely, the room is comfy and cosy.. everything was great! Eileen is a lovable lady and very helpful.. we had a good chat and laugh.. I stayed for 10 days and on the last day I feel like I don't want to come back to Germany.. it felt really like home to me. I would highly recommend to stay at Eileen's place!"
6350888,71512240,2016-04-25,53426494,Tingfeng,"Eileen is easy going and loving. She also gave me an Easter card for Easter during the first few days of my arrival. The house itself is a nice place to live as well. The neighborhood is quiet, and the nearest shopping center is about 13 minutes walking distance away for me, which isn't really too far. I would recommend this place!"
6350888,81211020,2016-06-21,31639234,Vicky,"Eileen is such a lovely host ready to answer any questions about the area and give directions if needed.  Her house is warm and inviting, with some very friendly pets ready for a cuddle or pat. Her house is only a quick train ride into central London, to all the sites.  The room was great, very comfy bed which i slept very well in."
6350888,83443714,2016-07-03,24643785,Gabby,"I booked last minute with Eileen after staying in a hostel and having things stolen. She replied straight away and allowed me to head to hers asap.<br/>It is a 15 minute walk to shops, quiet area. Simple to find. 15 min walk to the under ground. The room is nice, basic. <br/>She had 2 dogs and 2 cats there which were all friendly but if you don't like animals or the smell of them then obviously this isn't for you. Bathroom was nice. I took some dog hair home with me by accident..<br/>Eileen was nice, allowed me to use her phone, have the police around and  let me do my own thing "
6350888,83580187,2016-07-03,78807895,Rosalind,"Had a brief overnight stay with Eileen.  She is a fantastic, relaxed host and made me very welcome.  Really nice room, perfect for me. Thanks Eileen!!"

Quiet, safe neighbourhood within walking distance of underground station on central line. Eileen is a great host, flexible and very helpful. Two very friendly dogs. I really enjoyed my stay"
6350888,85192464,2016-07-10,9727513,Frank,eileen是一位慈祥的祖母，有礼貌，善教养。会邀请客人在花园品茶。家里的两条狗也很听话，没有与陌生人乱叫或纠缠。<br/>门外就是免费停车位，在伦敦非常珍贵。<br/>会推荐这个住处给其它朋友。
6350888,85661288,2016-07-12,67951537,Casey,"When I first arrived, someone was still in the room I was supposed to stay in. Luckily, I was only there very early to drop my belongings. Eileen was extremely welcoming along with her 2 dogs and 2 cats. The dogs stay downstairs and the bedrooms are upstairs. Eileen was such a great host and very welcoming! It felt very home-y staying with her. It was about a 10-15 minute walk to the underground and then an hour via tube to the city center (around Buckingham Palace) The neighborhood is cute quiet and feels safe. Eileen also gave great advice and I loved chatting with her, sitting in the living room watching tv. "
6350888,85794490,2016-07-13,35007129,Lenka,"I have found it without any issues, Eileen is so great and welcoming. Neighbourhood is quiet, very satisfied with all service. Highly recommended "
6350888,86318819,2016-07-16,50911864,Anas,"Nice lady, nice house, clean, nice garden, nice neighbourhood, peace and quiete. She is not the type to hassle you with too many questions. She will give you your space to do and go as you please. Polite, honest, direct and welcoming. She also has lovely dogs that I took for a walk paddling in the lake. Will I stay there again? YES!!"
6350888,86777202,2016-07-17,74149811,Magesh Kumar,Great place in the suburbs of London and a great host. Even though I stayed only for a couple of days I really had a good time. And Eileen is a great person. Felt happy to have met her. She even helped me get a cab when über failed.
6350888,94448095,2016-08-15,52874488,Carole,Mon hôte a été fantastique et disponible.<br/>Elle m'a facilité l'entrée de sa maison et aussi été d'une aide pour mon orientation à Londres.
6350888,95519924,2016-08-20,76073805,Chantal,De verhuurder heeft er alles aan gedaan om mij welkom te laten voelen! Ik kon haar alles vragen over routes bezienswaardigheden etc en ik kreeg ontbijt!
6350888,98158366,2016-08-29,65627275,Rodrigo,"I couldn't have had a better stay in London. Eileen is lovely, she has a dog (and there was another guest dog), both of which I found lovely, but they won't bother you if you don't want. The place is in a peaceful neighbourhood, not very far from the station, and it's really safe. I had a bedroom just for myself, could do my laundry and had plenty of space in the bathroom, that I consider really important. She was extremely helpful and a pleasant company to talk in the evenings when I got home early. I strongly recommend the place, of course, and look forward to going back soon!"
6350888,102181912,2016-09-17,68376165,Emily,"Staying at Eileen's house as a guest was a peaceful and friendly experience. I had some wonderful conversations, but equally Eileen lets you get on with things yourself. I arrived at Eileen's house for an approx. 2 week stay at the end of a previous tenancy and a postgraduate degree - which meant a lot of extra luggage and a chaotic schedule. The room was immaculate upon arrival, with Wifi code and water ready at the bedside (unfortunately it didn't long stay immaculate with me inside it...) Eileen was beyond generous before I even arrived, offering to store my extra luggage in her shed - and even let me do the same upon my departure until I can return to London collect the rest. The daily journey to the end of the Central line was slightly tiring towards the end, but worth it for the homely environment, as well as her lovely cat and two dogs. Eileen goes over and above what it typically means to be a host on Airbnb. I would definitely stay again if I needed accommodation in London! "
6350888,103179454,2016-09-21,31829764,Hannah,"I truly enjoyed my stay with Eileen.  She's helpful, friendly, and a good resource for anyone new to England and the London area.  The room was clean and house welcoming.  I would definitely recommend this listing to my friends!"
6350888,104068182,2016-09-25,17394967,Tulay,"Eileen's house is in a very nice neighborhood. It's very easy to get around London from her house; the walk to the underground is lovely. <br/>The house is super clean and very comfortable. <br/>But most of all, it's worth going to London just to meet Eileen. Her hospitality is beyond words. She was very very helpful with everything. <br/>I'll not stay anywhere else in London from now on. <br/>Thank you Eileen for making my trip such a pleasant one. <br/>Take care,<br/>Tulay. "
6350888,108209871,2016-10-15,39335293,Lucia,"I enjoyed my stay at Eileen's (1 week for a course) a lot.<br/>Communication was excellent both before and during my stay. <br/>I felt at home from the first day, also thanks to her furry friends.<br/>My room was exactly as described, small, cozy,well equipped."
6350888,111171685,2016-10-30,93633091,Dermot,"This was my first time using AirB&B so  I didn't know what to expect but from the minute I met Eileen at the door, I couldn't have been made more welcome. My stay was short, just over for the night for a football match but the house was lovely, warm and located in a quiet neighbourhood, about 5mins walk away from the nearest underground station. I'd definitely recommend "
6350888,123020635,2016-12-27,64625367,Lena,"Fantastic place to stay, rooms were big and great, Eileen was an excellent host. Would recommend staying here."
6350888,150053342,2017-05-07,102983875,Agnes,"I lived for several months in the room while on a work placement in central London and I couldn't be happier with my stay. Just as advertised! Easy and convenient to get into London. Both rooms are nice and comfortable, the smaller one has enough storage for it not to feel as small as it looks. Eileen is a great host; easy-going and helpful, but also direct about how she likes things, which makes it easy to relax and feel at home. I had a great four months in London and Eileen's hospitality played a big part in it - thanks again!"
6350888,167975001,2017-07-08,136667427,Pallavi,Felt like visiting a family member. :)

The room is clean and tidy and has enough storage space to unpack the essentials.  Its about a 10-15 minute walk from 3 different tube stations all on the central line which take you easily into central London, the West End, Stratford."

6350888,286526054,2018-07-06,147729324,彭乐乐,"Eileen is the best host I have ever met. She organizes everything so well that you do not have to worry about anything. It's really convenience to reach the tube, bus or any other transport. The house is really clean and it's enjoyable to stay here!  It's really a good place to stay that I highly recommend."

6350888,360118703,2018-12-19,213703112,Raquel,A very quiet and peaceful home.  Metro station within 13 minutes walk.   Buses to get to nearby station just @ the corner from the house.  Great sushi restaurant with the freshest ingredients within minutes.  Conveniently located.
6350888,362445256,2018-12-26,102522650,Robert,Eileen's house is about a 12 to 15 minute walk from 3 different tube stations in Zone 4 on the Central Line (past Westfields Shopping Ctr.) in Zone 4.  House is immaculate and delightfully quiet ... I slept very well.  Eileen is intelligent/respectful/generous.  Recommend.

6350888,446936338912270446,2021-09-08,56824875,Florence,"Eileen is a lovely, caring and thoughtful host. The house is well situated, close to the tube station, and in a safe area. It has everything you need during your stay, may it be long or short term. Everything you need in terms of shops is in close proximity. I would definitely recommend staying here  if you are looking for a peaceful and wonderful stay."
6470478,37784485,2015-07-10,36547366,Phillip,Very good experience. <br/>Karl was quick to respond and happy to help in anyway possible.<br/>Description and photos were a true representation of the venue.  <br/>Easy to walk to from tube station - Approximately 10 min.<br/>Flexibility on check-in.<br/>Neighborhood felt safe
6470478,39041993,2015-07-20,35824161,Annamarie,"My daughter and I received a very warm welcome from Karl and the staff at the Captain Cook Pub & Hotel when we visited London on vacation this summer.  The room was very neat and clean and well equipped with everything we could need.  The downstairs pub serves great food and I had my first scotch egg (never heard of this in NYC), which was delicious.  So was the truffle mac & cheese and the jerk chicken.  Not your usual pub fare.  It also has an outdoor terrace in the back, which was nice for relaxing after a long day touring London.  I've never been to Fulham before, and it was a great location for staying in London.  We were close enough to walk to the underground and yet far from the tourist crowds.  A wonderful vacation."
6470478,403187742,2019-01-20,211514238,Ric,"We had a great time at the Captain Cook - a really lovely room, huge bed and loads of amenities. Check in was a breeze and the pub is in a great area. The vibe is more of a cozy hotel than an AirBnB - cool decor too! If I HAD to make some comments I’d probably say turn the heating down in the room a tad (still much better than being too cold) and also there is a bit of noise from the street at night, but certainly nothing unbearable and for longer than 30secs. Thanks Karl and team, was great!"
6470478,423201781,2019-03-13,124865608,Mark,Brilliant AirBnB away from the noise and hassle of the central part of the city but so easy to get back in to the centre. Facilities were great as was the welcome and help we received to make sure that we had a great stay. (And the pub looked lovely - we wished that we just had an evening there instead of carrying our plans!)
6470478,719068962,2020-12-28,139071063,Dirk,"Karl a great Host,<br/>. .. you feel and see a traveling man with experience is running this place to accommodate the hotel guest wishes like no one ! <br/>A true and honest master of hospitality! Well worth the visit"
6479011,35703618,2015-06-21,34791426,Julia,This was our first air bnb booking and we were very pleased. It was a 5 minute walk to the party we were attending so very convenient for us. Melanie was very warm and welcoming. Her house is beautifully designed and we had a large attic room with great views and a lovely en suite bathroom. The house is situated on Chiswick Mall so is in a beautiful location for those wanting a stroll along the Thames in the morning. We would definitely book in with Melanie again. 
6479011,36565837,2015-06-29,29095793,Celia,I had a lovely stay! Melanie was very friendly. The room was quiet and spacious. Gorgeous part of London. Highly recommended! 
6479011,38430258,2015-07-15,36651282,Spyridon,"Melanie is an amazing hostess! We are really excited. The room is huge, extremely clean and quiet. The neighbourhood is very safe, full of families and it is located by the Thames river where you can have lunch,dinner or a pint in some of the most popular pubs of London. If we visit London again, we will definitely stay at Melanie's. It was an amazing experience!"
6479011,39797620,2015-07-26,36684675,Jia,"My parents really enjoyed their stay here, and it's all thanks to Melanie! :) She is an amazing host, absolutely friendly, welcoming and accomodating!

6479011,48954641,2015-09-29,44413904,Jeff,"This was my first AirBnB experience and it was fantastic. I was traveling on business with an open weekend.

It is a great location right on the Thames in Chiswick. Didn't have time to take up Melanies offer of coffee in the morning but she did recommend an excellent local Cafe for a takeaway breakfast.

It's about a five minute walk to the district line into the heart of the city but there are so many cute and fun places in the neighborhood. There is a picturesque walk along the Thames and I was within walking distance to many restaurants and shops. However, the real gem of this place is really Melanie herself. She is such a great hostess and went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable. She was helpful in providing directions and was informative on popular places in London. She has a very welcoming personality and I felt like we were old friends within minutes of being there. "

6479011,166069849,2017-07-02,35755944,Richard,Een geweldig weekend begin juli gehad bij Melanie. Toen we vertraging hadden met het vliegtuig en laat aankwamen is ze ons komen afhalen bij het metrostation. Ze was heel geïnteresseerd in onze Londen ervaringen. Het is een geweldige locatie dicht bij de rivier. Het is zalig om rustig langs het water te lopen richting Hammersmith. Daar is een groot winkelcentrum en goede metro verbindingen. De kamer is ruim en licht. Melanie gaat er nog een kastje en een bank inzetten. De ruimte is er groot genoeg voor.  De gedeelde keuken werkt prima. Je hebt je eigen plekje in de koelkast. Je hebt voldoende privacy. Volgende keer Londen begint absoluut weer bij Melanie. 
6479011,167063544,2017-07-05,21389269,Lorenzo,"Melanie is the perfect host: fondly, willing to help when you most need it, will offer you everything with no doubt. She makes her house your house.

Melanie's place is like having a private apartment, but hosted by your successful, creative bff. "

6479011,168771241,2017-07-10,28301314,Kelly,"Melanie's place is very nice and spacious. It is always a perk to get an entire floor to yourself! The location is very safe and quiet, and being right on the river is wonderful. The easy access to the Tube is also good. <br/><br/>One note about the en suite: for shower-lovers like me, you'll only get a bath. The tub is very nice, though!"

6479011,177602750,2017-08-03,54141779,Stacey,"Melanie's place was everything we could have hoped for! Large, comfortable and clean. Melanie was very easy to communicate with and she provided great knowledge of the local area. We would definitely recommend to anyone. "

The room is bright, confortable and overlooks gardens with a private bathroom (no shower but not a problem). The very well equipped kitchen is convenient and we just have to put dirty dishes in the machine. Melanie is very helpfull and it's interesting to talk with her. Communicate with her is easy. She was waiting for us in the street the first evening at 10pm ! Thanks a lot for your warm welcome Melanie (:"

6479011,199561328,2017-10-02,35857414,Olga,"Melanie’s place was comfortable, neat and very clean. It’s on the top floor of a typically English house. Spacious enough for the two of us plus one toddler. The bathroom is big enough for an average-sized person and nicely furnished. We had the chance to feel really British there as the tub and the sink have separate taps for cold and hot water <br/><br/>The location of the place is very convenient. About 6-8 minutes walk to the tube and buses, and there are also a few shops, cafes and pubs nearby. The Thames is just around the corner (literally!) which was perfect as we like long walks by the river. Although the place is also close to some kind of main arterial road, at night it was quiet enough to sleep without any problems. The traffic wasn’t bothering us.<br/><br/>As a host, Melanie is very nice, friendly and extremely helpful. She provided us with everything we needed. To be honest, our experience was so good that we regretted we had to leave after only a few days."
6479011,200672473,2017-10-06,15565378,Michael,"This is a very good location to use as a base for exploring London. Probably 25-30 minutes tube ride from St Pancras but worth it to be is a very fine suburb. Hammersmith, just by the river, with plenty for the inquisitive to see within walking distance. Some good eating places too e.g. the Dove. Davina Deli, a good place for breakfast.<br/>The room was just as described. Spacious and quiet on the top floor. You need to manage stairs OK. No shower but a very nice ensuite with bath. Melanie's instructions on how to get there were precise and accurate. <br/>Melanie is a relaxed and interesting host who took a genuine interest in us and our plans, offering good advice.<br/>This will be our usual place to stay in London in future, unless it's booked up!"
6479011,201881378,2017-10-09,138373832,Kent,We stayed here for two nights. It was a very comfortable room. It is around a 10 minute walk to the nearest tube station at Stamford Brook. Melanie is an excellent host and helped make our stay enjoyable.

6479011,204653892,2017-10-19,31897965,Ian,What a wonderful experience staying at Melanie's home. The room was perfect for us. Melanie was so incredibly friendly and hospitable and made us feel like friends rather than guests. Bed and pillows were very comfortable and hairdryer was fantastic. The situation next to Thames is excellent for those wanting to run or walk. Tranquil setting with birds waking you up in the morning.
6479011,206193481,2017-10-24,37681207,Dominique,"Le logement est tout à fait conforme à la description : quartier calme, à proximité des promenades des bords de la Tamise, chambre vaste occupant tout le troisième étage.

6479011,214633820,2017-11-26,127232764,Chantal,"For a two-night stay, my friend and I felt very at home and comfortable. The house was clean, and Melanie was absolutely lovely and so accommodating. Though the location was a little out of London, and thus a little tiring to navigate when coming home later at night, it was nonetheless a manageable transit and provided all the comforts one could want at a weekend getaway."

We found Melanie to be a genuinely nice, wonderfully considerate hostess whom offered much flexibility as well as kindness. <br/>The property is in a beautiful neighbourhood by the river, has a nice Italian delicatessen and a few pubs nearby and walking distance to an underground station (zone 2). <br/>We definitely recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere comfortable to stay in the area, and will be sure to return!"

6479011,234620081,2018-02-13,55769170,Vishal,"Melanie is a great host and regularly checked with us if everything was in order. She was also nice to make her kitchen available.The place is good value for money for it’s location - about 10 mins from the nearest tube and about 5-7 minutes walk for supermarket and restaurants. The room is quite spacious for London and should not be a problem if one has significant luggage. The bathroom has a bath tub and we had trouble adjusting to it, but Melanie was thoughtful of offering her bathroom with shower."

You get a huge private room on the top floor of a typical English terraced house, with an en-suite bathroom, also quite large (bathtub only, no shower). It feels almost like having a studio flat, with a comfortable double bed but also a desk, a sofa and a TV. All is quite new and impeccably clean. On top of all that, it's in a wonderful part of London, a quiet residential street only a few steps from the River Thames. Melanie was a lovely host, I look forward to returning again."

La habitación completa y cómoda; la casa victoriana y con encanto, al igual que el barrio y la anfitriona muy agradable, correcta y atenta con nosotros  para lo que necesitáramos. El Barrio nos ha gustado especialmente, con todo los servicios, casas encantadoras y con restaurantes internacional y comida local, además la casa estaba junto al Támesis, muy agradable para un paseo y tomar una cerveza en un típico pub. El metro más cercano está unos 10 min a pie, línea verde directa a Victoria así que muy bien comunicado para todos los que deseen estar cerca del centro pero alejados del bullicio. En definitiva una muy buena experiencia en casa de Melanie."

Das Zimmer in ihrem Haus ist groß, hell und sehr sauber. Wir hatten ein paar Bedenken wegen der fehlenden Dusche und der zwei Wasserhähne am Waschbecken und der Wanne, aber man gewöhnt sich schnell daran. Außerdem hat Melanie uns schon bei der Ankunft die Dusche in ihrem Badezimmer angeboten. Auch sonst war Melanie super nett und aufmerksam. Wir haben uns bei ihr sehr wohlgefühlt und kommen gerne wieder."

We had everything we needed and more, it felt like we were staying with a good friend.

The house is a real home from home and yet with all you’d wish for in ‘hotel’ standard accommodation. The room is excellent with even a sofa with TV.

My husband and I were greeted with a warm and welcoming smile, and we departed with hugs and hopes to see each other again. She was delightful to chat with, and she offered wonderful suggestions for sights to see and local places to eat. Our room was quiet, clean, and very comfortable. She is away from the city, but just a short walk to the Tube. A perfect location, in our opinion. Next time we visit London, Melanie will be our first call. "

She always made herself available for questions and her home is really inviting in a quiet spot. <br/><br/>The space is lovely and the bed is very comfortable, which is great after a long day of seeing everything London has to offer! Nice amenities and the room is very roomy for two people. <br/><br/>The neighborhood is lovely and quiet; just steps from the Thames for a stroll, run or bike ride.  One thing I love about Melanie's place is, it feels tucked away but also close to both buses and the tube.  Just on the edge of zone 2 it was a quick trip to everything we wanted to see! It really was a great respite from the hustle of perhaps a busier neighborhood. <br/><br/>Take all of her tips on places to eat in the area, every recommendation is spot on!"

Her home is located in a quiet neighbourhood that's a convenient walk to the Hammersmith Station and Thames River. Our room was as advertised, and our host kindly offered us tea/coffee ahead of our dawn departure. Unfortunately our room was not warm enough so we asked for the heat to be turned on which she obliged. However, it was still colder than we had anticipated. Other than that we had an uneventful stay."

The neighborhood is cute and the walk to the tube was easy. Melanie was very kind and we had ample amenities for our 10 day stay. There’s a few sets of stairs to get to the lofted room but we didn’t care at all since the room was huge and the bed was extremely comfy! No shower in the room but the bath was perfect after the hours of walking we did. Water was hot and WiFi was good. Thanks again, Melanie!"

Just don't stand up straight in the bath! It's under a sloping ceiling! Melanie was very helpful; good instructions on how to find her place, giving us some local information & printing out our 2 for 1 voucher.  Her home is in a lovely area, almost village like. It's just a minute from the river where there are several good pubs close by. We would definitely return without hesitation. Just a shout out for The Ritz Cafe along the main road. It's basically a workmens cafe but it's spotlessly clean and does one of the best cooked breakfasts we've had at a very reasonable price."
6479011,459401031,2019-05-27,55083942,Jamie,"We had a lovely time staying at Melanie's. The house is located right next to the river and an easy 15 minute stroll into Hammersmith or a 5 minute walk to the nearest tube at Stamford Brook so the centre of London is easy to get to.

It's nice to have breakfast in the kitchen with a patio. I can highly recommend the place and would come again. <br/>Bring some ear tips if you sleep with open windows and you're very sensitive to some traffic noise. Other than that you will enjoy the near Thames and numerous cafes and restaurants in the area.

I’m not much of a chatty person, but I was drawn to have conversation. Really, she’s the sweetest. So patient, kind and extremely helpful. <br/><br/>I stayed in a room with my own full bathroom. Top floor. It was very quiet and private. Might be a little squeeze going up the stairs with an oversized suit case. My carry-ons were easy. <br/><br/>The space was clean and stylish. She put a lot of thought into making her guests comfortable. Bed was comfortable enough for me. The European baths are divine! Just watch your head if you use the shower attachment. Might cramp a tall person. But with w a bath like her’s you just have to treat yourself with a soak! <br/><br/>I enjoyed visiting London and plan to stay here when I visit again!"
6479011,544162888,2019-10-09,20230738,Pamela,"The house is situated in a beautiful historic area, right by the Thames. The tube is a lovely 7 min walk away, with a wonderful choice of cafes nearby.

You are about a 7 minute walk to the nearest tube station which is really handy and very easy to use! There are several excellent places to walk to for food/coffee, two being just seconds from the front door. The room is very nice and open, it's on the 3rd floor with steps leading up. There is a squeaky clean bathroom attached which is private to the guests use. The bed is comfy, and there's a TV with Netflix.

6479011,553517098,2019-10-24,250811654,Jean,"Melanie was a wonderful host and if we could have given her more than 5 stars we would have. She has a beautiful house in one of the nicest parts of London there is. It's on a lovely quiet road and only a couple of minutes away from The Black Dog pub, quickly followed but at least 3 more pubs along the Thames  before you get to Hammersmith Bridge . Tube close by, also a nice Italian Deli that serves coffee and Croissants  just a few yards away. We will definitely be back ."
6479011,555041274,2019-10-27,48752377,Shirley,We are returning guests to Melanie’s. We agree with her previous reviewers - she’s one of the most friendliest people you could meet and a brilliant host. We enjoyed our stay as usual and hope to come back in the near future.

6479011,570354170,2019-11-29,117468052,Emily,"If you're not concerned with a few stairs and a short tube ride to center city, this is a FABULOUS place to stay whilst in London. Quiet street right along a gorgeous river path, pubs a'plenty nearby, and a great excuse to explore lesser known areas of the city. Everything was spotless and very comfortable, and Melanie was very willing to make herself as helpful as possible in making sure things ran smoothly for us during our stay. <br/>A great big THANK YOU to our wonderful host and we hope we get the chance to stay with you again! xx"
6479011,572625920,2019-12-03,7733786,Timothy,Very clean room up two flight of stairs. Melanie gave me a warm welcome and was very helpful. Easily recommended to all future guests.

It is within easy walking distance of various tube stations. The room on the top floor is stylish white with pops of zingy colour. The bedding is very comfortable and the en suite is luxurious with a proper sized bath. Melanie was a very hospitable host. We would definitely stay here again.
6479011,576083427,2019-12-12,30420551,Sarah,Booked for my daughter who was working in London that week. Spacious clean room in beautiful house. Close to amenities and transport. Perfect.

The area is very charming— a path along the River Thames is 1 minute away from the house, plenty of markets and restaurants around for food and necessities. 10 out of 10!!"
6479011,475860772119401246,2021-10-18,415594591,Thanin,I stayed with this accommodation for over a month and Melanie is definitely one of the best host that you can find. She is easy to talk to and always keen to help you resolve any inconvenience if it arises. Definitely recommending this accommodation for both long and short term stay.

6479011,484554246719063593,2021-10-30,14677205,Khairiyah,Melanie is a pleasant and kind host. Simple gestures like asking how was my day and wishing me a lovely day made the stay even more pleasant. <br/><br/>The room is big and had a computer table which was useful for working. Toilet was also big and had a bathtub with a shower extender. Room has everything you need.<br/><br/>The tube is a 10 min walk. The area around the house is relatively safe. There is a cafe just a minute’s walk for some lovely breakfast.

Melanie is a great host and has a lovely house situated in a beautiful part of London right on the Thames. A 20 minute walk along the river to the Hammersmith apollo passing five Riverside pubs along the way, perfect . Will definitely book again when we visit the Apollo in the future. Free weekend parking aswell always a bonus in London. <br/>Thanks Melanie"
6479011,501961158158298764,2021-11-23,431473570,Karen,"This was my second stay at this Air BNB and I was not disappointed. It was as consistently good as my last stay -infact I have booked again for next week as I need to be in London for business again. It is a great location with so many wonderful local restaurants , cafes, pubs and shops and I am definitely thinking of booking another stay for pleasure as I want to stay on the weekend to fully enjoy all that this area has to offer.<br/>Thank you Melanie for making me feel so welcome and I will definitely be referring you to friends and family."
6479011,505593047918677606,2021-11-28,192025585,Scott,"Melanie's place is great for a stay in the city. Its a short (15 minute Riverside) stroll from the eventim Apollo in Hammersmith and a short walk from the district line giving easy access tobthe rest of London<br/><br/>A very well equipped kitchen :) faultless communication and brilliant little touches (like the guide books in the room, and personal recommendations for places to go)"

She and Sarah really cared about making our stay great and were so nice and helpful, we'd definitely stay here again if ever back in London!"

6623759,426540504,2019-03-21,24357405,Irit,"The apartment is in a good location, near kings road but I was very upset to find a Nespresso machine without capsules for making coffee and not clean for use. All the apartment wasn’t so clean. The bad was very soft and my friend slept on coach at guest room. The place very small even for 2 people. On picture it seems like big one. No big mirrors, just one small at bathroom. Windows are broken and its cold because the wind is getting inside. Also it’s very noisy at 7 am you hear someone walking upstairs and talking and you can’t sleep. The apartment is at -1 floor with tiny stairs. So if you have a big baggage it can be a big problem to care it down. Geeta was nice, I asked to fix batteries and she tried to help and take care. If you gonna stay there bring everything, from toilet paper to shampoo and soap and toothpaste and capsules for Nespresso!"
6623759,451871912,2019-05-12,36575931,John,"The neighborhood was very nice and full of very expensive stores to view.  The bed was not very comfortable and the noise upstairs always worked well as an alarm clock.  The unit was quite large and the kitchen was well supplied.  If you are taller than average, you will have to learn quick how not to hit your head going into the bathroom."
6623759,461278588,2019-05-31,77439091,Jo,Fantastic location and great host - we will stay here again on our next visit to London
6623759,524707583,2019-09-06,250127854,Mark,Great location. Chelsea is a wonderful neighborhood. Great places to eat and shop. Easy access to transportation. It worked for us as a place to sleep because we were out everyday.
6623759,535431543,2019-09-24,10699997,Anne,"The location is great.  The flat is just off a great part of the King's Road with lots of wonderful shopping and restaurants and also handy for tube and buses.  The flat is central and yet very quiet, a great neighbourhood.  The kitchen is well equipped, with plenty of cups, glasses, plates, cutlery, etc.  as well as pots/pans for making your own meals.  It would have been handy to have a microwave.   The bathroom is modern, shower/bath work well.  It was good to have the washer/dryer.  The flooring throughout the apartment is very nice wood.   Everything was very clean.   Wifi worked well.  Good communication with Geeta.  A very good experience."
6623759,560623808,2019-11-07,82759199,Eduardo,"Very confortable place, near bus an subway. High class neighborhood. Geeta is very kind"

6623759,573166295,2019-12-05,164958546,Bacb,"Very convenient, very spacious and I enjoyed my stay. Will be back"
6623759,578349311,2019-12-17,87550580,Shuaib,"The Good: <br/>- Very central in London.<br/>- Good value for what you pay. <br/>- Super nice hosts, and very responsive; allowed us to check-in early and check-in was a breeze and anytime we needed anything we would just ring their bell. <br/>- Very nice and spacious, has a full kitchen, washer and dryer was super convenient. <br/>- Provided dishes, pots, pans, and other kitchen gadgets.<br/><br/>The Not-so-Good: <br/>- It felt like we were staying at a place where someone is currently living. <br/>- Do not expect a professional style stay as you would feel at a hotel, or as you might have in other Air B&Bs.<br/>- Cleanliness of the place was average to below, was rather dusty. <br/>- The blankets seemed very old/used. <br/>- The shower head would not stay up (had to use a shaving razor handle as a wedge to hold it up) and the tub would clog up (there seemed to be hair or something else clogging the tub drain). <br/>- Cleanliness of dishes was not great, the kettle had some weird gunk inside of it and decided not to use it anymore, the cupboards were very unkempt with things kind of strewn about. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: <br/>The place was great on a budget, and location, and the people are super nice. If you are looking for a hotel-like cleanliness feel this is not the place for you; however if you can look past that than it's worth staying at."

Just off the Kings Road in the heart of Chelsea, lots in walking distance and only a few minutes walk to the tube to go further afield. Geeta was a lovely, friendly host who answered our questions very quickly. Would definitely stay again if in the area."
6623759,608626646,2020-02-21,128232052,Gerard,"Great place, great location. Basement apartment in a beautiful house located in a stylish residential square off Kings Road in the borough of Chelsea/Kensington. I would highly recommend it. Certainly worth a visit and is suitable for all ages. The Saatchi Museum is located very close to it and the Egyptian exhibition of King Tut is a must see. That will end on 3 May 2020. Top marks to Geeta our host. We will certainly be back. Thanks again."

6856552,36469262,2015-06-28,33338094,Marc,Bethany was a great host and showed me around her flat when I got there. The flat was nice and very handy. It's located at a good neighborhood and with good access links to the city through Kensel Rise and Kensel Green station. Both of these stations are only a five minutes walk from the flat. I stayed there for five days and my stay was good. I recommend her place. 
6856552,38940246,2015-07-19,23330325,Georgios,Modern and clean flat. Nice area with convenient tube station.<br/>Much recommended 
6856552,46739468,2015-09-13,24280922,Claire,Description was accurate and keys were sent according to instructions. Bethany kept in touch while I was there to check things were ok. Host was great and responsive. 
6856552,47841417,2015-09-21,43528897,Joshua,"Lovely top floor apartment with everything you need. The flat is very spacious and is 5 minutes walk from the Kinsel Rise tube station enabling fast and easy access to central London (where I was working). The neighbourhood is friendly, with various shops and a pub opposite the flat. You will find more shops such as a Tesco by the Kinsel Rise tube station which is convenient when you've finished work and want to grab a few things before heading back. Over all, great place - highly recommended!"
6856552,51960789,2015-10-25,37501993,Laura,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the apartment, very well kept and in such an ideal location with bus stops, overground and underground stations were all in walking distance.  I would defiantly recommend staying here!"
6856552,55833687,2015-12-06,48348896,Tallulah,"Wonderful apartment in a great location. The pub next door and deli over the road are great. Communication was great, and Bethany was really accomodating. Would definitely recommend and stay again!"
6864292,35891277,2015-06-22,1838624,Tamara,"Ben's place is lovely, quietly set back from Camberwell, it is brilliantly situated opposite the park. We had such a lovely stay and everyone in the house were really accommodating and friendly! The bed was super comfy and it was so nice to wake up to birds singing outside our window. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a peaceful and zenful experience! Also we also kidnapped the cat as we just completely fell in love with it...I think it loved us too... Thanks so much Ben and Aurelie for your wonderful hospitality! "
6864292,39210193,2015-07-21,25892815,Lo,I stayed at Ben's with my friend Emma who was staying in the UK from Australia. It was perfect for our needs - a clean and comfortable room before taking my friend out to show her the sights etc. The cat (cannot remember her name!) was so adorable and the other housemates pleasant. 
6864292,43393046,2015-08-19,24159067,Emi,"Aurelie and her boy were very kind and friendly. They gave us a lot of information about london pubs, shop and food. It's s typical english house with everything you need, in a quite district in front of a green park. "

6930884,37112061,2015-07-04,151639,Duncan,"This was a great experience and, in fact, one of the few visits where I wish I had more time to hang out in the flat. The location is just preposterously central, and it could not be better. It's astonishingly quiet. Fabio is an excellent host. The apartment is compact and traditionally furnished in line with its setting in a traditional 'mansion block' of flats. The building itself seems to be a secure, friendly community and I didn't feel concerned for my safety at all. I should mention though that the door to the flat needs a shove to make sure the lock catches the hasp. I once found the door looking closed when was actually unlocked.<br/><br/>Fabio is, I think, now starting out as an airbnb host. I know he already has a keen eye for some improvements he'd like to make, and I know an internet connection and a shower curtain were already planned. As it stands, it's a great value apartment and an amazing location."
6930884,37599105,2015-07-08,35836756,Maita,"Fabio made sure that he was there to welcome me even if it was already way past the check in time. The place is right in the heart of London City, just a stone's throw away from shopping malls and walking distance to Hyde Park...quite convenient for anyone who is new in the city. "
6930884,38217576,2015-07-13,5695846,Walter,"Stayed with Fabio for 5 nights in June 2015.  He was very welcoming and helped me get settled into the room.  The room was exactly as described on the site.  Although it wasn't the most stylish room, that was not what I was looking for.  It was very clean, as was the rest of the apartment, and comfortable.  I did not spend much awake time in the place, but the location was great for someone visiting London.  Really centrally located and literally on top of a tube station.  Fabio went out of his way to ensure that I was comfortable, even going to far as to ask what kind of breakfast food I liked so that he could pick some up and putting out hotel soaps and amenities in the bathroom. It is clear that Fabio is trying to improve the place for his AirBnB guests, while I was there the internet was upgraded from a slow service with poor signal to a fast service with good coverage throughout the flat.  Also, Fabio was working on a solution to a somewhat weird, but totally functional shower curtain situation.  I would be surprised if it wasn't resloved by now, but could always take a bath.  I would not typically suggest this when away from home, but this place was so clean that it would be fine.  Also, I kinda suspect that Fabio was cleaning the bathroom multiple times per day, but I never caught him.  I would definitely stay again. "
6930884,39339193,2015-07-22,36965279,Deborah,"Best location! Two metro lines next door. Less than a 5 min Walk to Hyde Park, Marble Arch and Tourist Open Bus stops. Oxford street 30m. <br/>Fabio is a lovely host! Happy, courteous and friendly. Great room for single stay... Comfortable bed, closet, drawers, fluffy towels, aromatherapy soaps etc. Great coffee and kitchen available with fridge. Well priced for size and location! Thanks Fabio for a lovely stay- 4 nights. My first time to London... Recommend!"
6930884,40006299,2015-07-27,23522171,Ashok,"Very centrally located in the heart of London. Fabio was an excellent host and provided different suggestions in terms of places to eat, things to see etc. "
6930884,40816649,2015-08-02,34101058,Jana,"The accommodation at Fabio was excellent. The flat was clean, quiet and I could use all flat. Fabio was very friendly. He was ready to help me anytime. He allowed me to check in earlier according to my arrival. The locality is great next to the tube station Bond street near many sights. I can recommend this place 100%. <br/>Jana"
6930884,42325600,2015-08-12,535055,Carly,"Fabio was a wonderful host! I had a lovely time discussing the area and life with him. The shower was hot, the bathroom clean, and a lovely sitting area with large open windows for a breeze to read, relax, and have breakfast by. Very central area, next to a tube stop and near several parks. Would reccommend. "
6930884,44226780,2015-08-24,14701712,Ben,"Anfitrião: Uma pessoa agradável e que possui ótimo senso de humor. <br/>Local: Clássico, limpo, colchão com molas e roupa de cama de alta qualidade.<br/>Localização: Excelente<br/>Importante: Infelizmente o anfitrião não possui smartphone e sugiro que peça o contato telefônico pois, se você esquecer ou perder a chave, não conseguirá contacta-lo pelo sistema Airbnb. <br/><br/>  "
6930884,44914883,2015-08-30,23909544,Ali,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I am happy to say it was a pleasant one. The room and the flat were spotlessly clean and tidy. The bed is very comfortable and the room is quiet due to being at the back. Fabio is an excellent host; friendly, personable and considerate of guests' needs. I would recommend this accommodation to anyone seeking a central location at a reasonable price.  "
6930884,46428608,2015-09-10,3526241,Christophe,I felt very welcome in Fabio's flat. He was very friendly and made sure I had everything I needed during my stay. And the flat's location is perfect: very central but not noisy at all. I'll come back!
6930884,46717352,2015-09-13,35825192,Laurel,Great central location. Host is kind. Having the owner of the apartment pop in each evening is somewhat unusual and not what I expected. 
6930884,47869435,2015-09-21,44068854,Marcello,"Great location! And a quiet, clean room. Fabio was a kind and very friendly host. He was nice enough to accept that I checked in at midnight!"

Fabio's flat is cozy, clean and well furnished. Perfect location! It is directly above Bond St station. You can't get a better location than this. I will surely return to book.<br/>"

There is a second room at this listing, and Mortimer advised me of this prior to my arrival so I knew who else would be staying. <br/>The room was small but comfortable for a solo traveller, and appeared as it does on the listing. <br/>All in all my stay was a good experience."

It was generally really quiet, the only noise being when lots of hot water was drawn, but this was inevitably during normal hours so no problem. Extremely convenient being right next to Bond St station, and a 1 minute walk to Oxford St. Recommended.."

Easy access to the Bond Street station and many good restaurants nearby. Mortimer's detailed directions, extensive recommendations, and general hospitality made it a joyful stay.

The location can’t be beat—right near the tube—and quiet and safe despite being in the heart of London. Great for solo female travel. Springs in the mattress are slightly uncomfortable but minor detail in an otherwise delightful apartment. Hope to return someday!"

The place is quite old fashioned, with a bed that could probably stand to be replaced (I could feel the springs digging in) and creaky floors. All I needed was a place to sleep which was perfect for me."

6966615,81994771,2016-06-26,79133472,Max,"Belvedere House was a very good deal for the cost. The staff was helpful, and my roommate—who had lived there for a year—was very welcoming. The house is a short walk from the tube station, and the area is great. I recommend bringing your own blanket(s) and pillow(s), as the blanket provided is more of a comforter, and the pillow was not too comfortable. Overall I had a positive experience. "

7275367,48176462,2015-09-24,24665624,Glenda,"We arrived 2 hours later than expected from Heathrow and Ali greeted us with warmth and friendliness. He couldn't have been a more gracious host. The flat was more than we had hoped for. Although advertised as a basement, it is really predominantly above ground. The kitchen space is airy and bright, complete with a skylight. The place is beautifully equipped with everything one would need for a pleasant stay. The flat is located round the corner, a 3 minute walk to the West Brompton Tube Station which gets you into the heart of London easily. We highly recommend Ali's flat and would love to come back."
7275367,48999504,2015-09-30,37786350,Sally,"after an initial mixup with the key we were very happy with our accommodation. location, facilities, rooms were all as described on the website. we would recommend this basement flat to others. "

7275367,52226223,2015-10-27,22418710,Santiago,Great location. Awesome apartment. 
7275367,52599140,2015-10-31,44858533,Becky,We had a very good stay at your house its very modern and very clean its in a really good location and close to the nearest underground would definitely come back on our next trip to London Becky.
7275367,56403618,2015-12-13,49236395,Mariana,Estava tudo óptimo.  As condições da casa eram óptimas.  A única coisa a melhorar seria o facto dos talheres serem de plástico. 
7275367,57228388,2015-12-23,17705636,Philipp,Ali war ein sehr netter Gastgeber. Bereits die Kommunikation im Vorhinein war sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich. Die Wohnung liegt parktisch und bietet im nahem Umfeld alles notwendige. Zudem war sie sehr sauber und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Wir können insgesamt nur das Beste berichten. Immer wieder! 
7275367,60209154,2016-01-20,1639437,Stuart,"A lovely stay; thank you Ali.<br/><br/>The apartment is crisp, contemporary and minimal, with large bedrooms, classy bathrooms and a very well-equipped kitchen, all of which were immaculate. A few little touches in other rooms ... perhaps some second-hand books, a small selection of DVDs, more cushions or throws ... would perfect the luxury-home feel—but I hasten to add that the tariff is very good value for all that's offered. The outdoor space will be great in summer; in winter we found the whole flat bright and warm. <br/><br/>Just as described, the tube is a few moments' walk from the front door, and it's very well connected for central and west London. The surrounding streets are generally residential, but within about 15-20-minutes' walk are all the shops, restaurants and attractions of Earls Court, Fulham and High Street Kensington. We wandered further on foot, to South Kensington, Hyde Park and Knightsbridge, before arriving back tired but happy ... it's a treat to explore without needing the tube to see everything. <br/><br/>Communication with Ali was prompt and helpful, and we were met by Lyuba, whose especial charm and kindness made us feel immediately at home. We're very glad to recommend this home-from-home."
7275367,60999374,2016-01-30,28476093,Nadja,"We were coming to London for 4 nights and needed somewhere central to stay. We were so happy with Ali's property because the flat is even better than the pictures. It's a very short walk to West Brompton tube station.<br/>Our flight was delayed and we arrived at the property just before midnight where we were met by Lubya who was so welcoming and accommodating to our late arrival. Ali was in touch before our flight in to see if we needed any thing buying for us as well.<br/>The flat was warm and clean, each bedroom has a walk in closet as well ample space to move around which is rare for London. Two bathrooms were a plus!<br/>A couple of the best amenities of the property which isn't mentioned is the dishwasher and Sky channels!  Saved us a lot of washing up and some good TV to wind down to.<br/>Will definitely book again with Ali's property next time we are in London!"
7275367,62033594,2016-02-10,20867291,Judy,"The place is located near West Bromption tube station, only 2 mins walk.  The apartment is newly renovated with good taste. THe equipment and home facilities are state-of-art. The cleaning is excellent.  The glass ceiliing in kitchen area allows sunlight directly lead into the sitting room. A small bonus is there is a private garden for my kid doing morning exercise.Ali is very responsive and friendly. THe living environmnet give us more than a 5-star hotel standard.  We are very happy staying in this lovely house.  "
7275367,63086741,2016-02-20,18398752,Kate,Beautiful  apartment around corner from the tube station.
7275367,64431213,2016-03-04,8004464,Miguel Angel,"We didn´t  meet Ali, but Luybas received us very late at Sunday nigth, a She was very patient to explain all the facilities althoug it was 1am!!!<br/><br/>Home was really as the photos show, perfect wifi, very bright dinning room, ...<br/><br/>very close to underground and safe area.<br/><br/>We will be there next time we visit London<br/><br/>Thank you very much"

7275367,67846234,2016-03-31,54165768,Nilesh,A very comfortable apartment like a home away from home. The host's representative was available at the exact time of check-in as discussed earlier.
7275367,69225132,2016-04-10,14760315,Daniel,Everything was fine. Thank you!
7275367,71477395,2016-04-25,55526595,Anna,"Everything was perfect. The apartment is comfortable and quiet, close to the underground - to the center and the airport - and – very important! - corresponding to the photos and the description.<br/>Lyuba, Ali’s housekeeper, was helpful and really friendly.<br/>It was a great holiday!"
7275367,71985300,2016-04-30,30603892,Fernando,"Excellent flat in a great part of London.  The flat was as described -- very spacious, modern bathrooms and comfortable.  The kitchen was great ... perhaps a little too much light coming in with the all-ceiling skylight.  The owner (Ali) was very responsive and had the flat ready when we showed up.  Overall, very nice.  I would surely stay there again."
7275367,76603319,2016-05-28,52488071,Merrilyn,"We were met by Ali and Lyuba on arrival as arranged. The flat is great in the perfect position. As described it is spacious, modern and comfortable. Kitchen is bright and the small backyard perfect for drinks in the afternoon. We had a wonderful holiday and would definitely return if in London again."
7275367,77764888,2016-06-03,48418547,Walter,The flat was very practical for our trip to London.  We only had a 3 minute walk to our conference.  Lubya was very helpful with explaining everything about the flat when we arrived.  The only issue we found was one of the toilets had a small water leak.  A good value for someone needing two bedrooms and private baths.
7275367,78377738,2016-06-06,10723027,Warwick,"Had a good visit, great place to stay if you are heading to Gatwick airport afterwards as Easybus Gatwick pickup is just around the corner. Would stay again."
7275367,79991428,2016-06-15,3053948,Edward,Ali's flat was in a great location and a very beautiful space.!  We really enjoyed our 3 day stay.  
7275367,84393520,2016-07-07,2348340,Gioconda,"It is a wonderful flat, very bright and the   bedrooms are every spacious. Everyone was very kind and helpful. The location is great, close to restaurants and shops. Thank you for the lovely experience."
7275367,143094570,2017-04-10,13649195,Catherine,Fantastic modern apartment very close to the tube. Feels spacious and homely with everything you need. Really appreciated Ali personally coming to meet us late in the evening after our long flight. Added bonus was the little garden at the back which our kids loved.<br/>
7275367,145431741,2017-04-18,45552947,Farah,The house is amazing! I love the white interior and the cleanliness of the house. The neighbourhood is also great. Morning market is just less than 10minutes walk from home and tube station is around 3minutes walk. Definitely would come back here again in the future.
7275367,146905827,2017-04-24,55171626,Stefano,"Ottima posizione.<br/>Location perfetta per una famiglia di quattro persone. <br/>Ali e Alma precisi, cortesi e disponibili. <br/>Consigliato. "
7275367,152739529,2017-05-18,57130111,Michelle,Great location near the West Brampton tube station. Our first dinner was at Lilly's pub nearby. Very good food but sort of pricey. Ali is a great host and very responsive to questions and concerns. Her place is ideal if you want a quiet place that is centrally located. There's a nearby grocery store just past the tube station too where we stocked up on breakfast food and snacks.
7275367,155909643,2017-05-29,119897661,Elizabeth,"This was a great flat for our family of 4.  The space was great and the check-in/out was very easy.  We were 2 blocks away from the train station and bus stops.  Thank you for sharing your apartment, we had a great stay!"
7275367,159194420,2017-06-10,26443316,Heather,"My husband and I recently stayed 10 days at Ali's apartment, along with my 83-year-old mother-in-law. We all really appreciated the apt's terrific location - literally a 3-minute walk to the West Brompton tube station and multiple bus routes - which was much more central than I realized from just looking at a city map. The neighbourhood of Fulham Broadway is just a 10 minute walk away and has everything you could ask for - good restaurants, multiple grocery shopping options (inc Whole Foods), a mall and cinema, and bars and pubs. There are also a couple of gastro pubs even closer - we recommend the Lille Langtry.<br/><br/>The apartment could benefit from a few personal touches and amenities such as a broom and new pillows, but it has extremely comfortable beds and an amazing shower (bathrooms were recently renovated) - so we all felt really rested and refreshed during our stay. The little outdoor garden was a nice treat to sit out in on sunny evenings after a day touring the city.<br/><br/>Last but definitely not least, Ali was a terrific host - very responsive when we had questions, quick to check up on us after the London Bridge tragedy, and very gracious when my goof-up with the keys upon leaving meant he had to get a locksmith (Note - do NOT leave the keys in the door!). Thank you again for helping to make out trip so memorable, Ali!"
7275367,169571112,2017-07-13,121526343,Stephen,Great host experience.  Great location.  Fair price 
7275367,172301163,2017-07-20,671832,Liebe,This airbnb property has the essentials for a short stay in London. Ali was a good host - easy to deal with and very responsive.
7275367,291128493,2018-07-15,70059223,Lucy,"El departamento está bien, cuenta con lo necesario y está muy cerca de una estación de metro! "
7275367,301004737,2018-08-03,46258372,Lauren,"We had a lovely weeklong stay at Ali’s flat! Myself, my husband, our two kids, and my mother all stayed here quite comfortably. The apartment was very clean and inviting, beds comfortable, kitchen spotless. Ali was even kind enough to stock up a few extra items in the refrigerator and provide a high chair for the infant. When he met us in person to check in he gave us lots of local tips on where to eat, things to do, places to see. The garden was lovely, our kids enjoyed, and the washer/dryer was a big help. Location was great, just off the West Brompton stop on the District line, far enough removed from the city to escape the hustle and bustle but close enough that you’re within all the major attractions in minutes. My only word of caution if visiting in summer: I didn’t read the apartment description carefully enough and there’s no AC (totally my mistake as it’s clearly stated). Wasn’t a problem for us as we live in an NYC apartment without AC as well, but did come as a shock to some of our traveling companions. The kitchen has a glass roof, so if it’s a particularly hot day outside the apartment does get very warm during the day, but cools<br/>off nicely at night and Ali provided plenty of fans which we put to good use (we were gone most of the time during the day anyway so was largely a non-issue). Overall a great stay and would highly recommend!"
7275367,304774728,2018-08-10,178116352,Katherine,"We really enjoyed staying in Ali's flat as it was located in a cute neighborhood, conveniently located near the West Brompton tube station (5 minute walk) and super close to a great pub, food locations and bodega. The Prince is an amazing garden themed bar and food hall that you MUST visit! We ate there several times (tried all of the different little restaurants) and they even had a high chair for my baby (big bonus!). The closest grocery store we found was about a 15-20 minute walk. The flat itself was clean, modern and updated. I loved that Ali provided special touches like umbrellas and a high chair. There is no AC but there are large fans provided in each room. The kitchen/dining room/living room is fairly open with skylights and other windows so it does become quite warm in the summer. There is also a cute backyard which we never got to enjoy, unfortunately. There is a television but either regular cable isn't provided or I wasn't able to figure it out. The DVD player did work and there are lots of DVD's provided. Luckily the WiFi worked well so we were able to stream from the iPad. We were quite comfortable staying here and would definitely recommend it. The check-in and check out process were both convenient. Thank you for everything Ali!"
7275367,306825546,2018-08-13,57833370,Geoff,"Stylish Basement apartment with spacious kitchen/ diner/living, spacious bedrooms with excellent beds. Excellent transport links with 5 min walk to tube. Great outdoor space too an added bonus"
7275367,310940307,2018-08-20,63083797,Parvez,"The place is at a great location. It is walking distance from West Brompton (2-min) and Earls Court (10-min). There is a convenience store that is 1-min away. The police offices are across the street. The street is quiet, low traffic and very pleasant.  Our family (2 of us and 3 kids) went for walks pretty much every evening and enjoyed the neighborhood!<br/><br/>The place itself is clean and the layout is nice and simple - all on one level. The garden at the back is a great place to have tea/chill. <br/><br/>The bedrooms are good sized and no-frills. The 2 bathrooms are also decent sized and no-frills. The bathroom attached to the main bedroom is a bit tight (we come from the US, where everything is a bit over-sized)....<br/><br/>The shower needs some basic update - putting a soap/toiletry/shampoo rack/stand in the shower will be great. We had to leave the shampoo/soap/etc on the floor, while showering. The shower drain need some clean-up - water gets filled up quickly and in a few minutes, you are showering in a bit of a puddle (eeks)...<br/><br/>The kitchen is well equipped and nicely done. All the appliances worked well....we enjoyed cooking breakfast there every day....<br/><br/>Ali was a great host - we never saw him in person, but very responsive and let us drop our bags before check in time.....<br/><br/>Highly recommend!"
7275367,323750625,2018-09-16,87268427,Bruno,All good!
7275367,330255037,2018-09-30,208283719,Clara,"Ali’s flat was clean, spacious, modern, and great for our week stay in London. The two bedrooms and pull-out couch allowed us each a separate area to sleep - also, having 2 bathrooms for 3 women was a plus! The back patio was a lovely feature - we relaxed out there in good weather. The kitchen had all the basic appliances (microwave, hot water boiler, toaster, full fridge) that allowed us to eat in and save some $$$. <br/><br/>The flat is conveniently about a two minute walk from the West Brompton underground station. It takes about a half hour to get to the popular tourist locations and we typically had to transfer tube lines once per trip out. The neighborhood itself was quiet and quaint with several local grocery options and eateries a block away.  <br/><br/>Ali was very responsive to all my random questions about where to find things and was very accommodating and kind. I definitely recommend!"
7275367,335495860,2018-10-12,61274929,Andreas,It is a great apartment in a great location with a small store just around the corner. Can only recommend it.
7275367,337080102,2018-10-15,11546776,Karen,"We (my sister, her 6 year old, and I) enjoyed our stay at Ali's flat. It was very clean, and the check in process was easy and went smoothly. It's in a good location- steps from the underground and overground as well as bus routes. We suggested he get a coffee maker of some sort as we missed that, but the garden is a big bonus."
7275367,340925419,2018-10-25,32198981,Pascal,Nice appartement close to West Brompton station. One of the bed is quite noisy and too soft for us but otherwise it was a good experience.
7275367,367237117,2019-01-04,49533122,Simone,"Lovely, light and bright place which is still cosy and warm in winter. Great location so close to the Tube / District Line. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you!"
7275367,400873168,2019-01-13,104727854,Susanne,"Lovely stay! I stayed there with my family and the apartment was perfect! Perfect size for 4-5 people and especially the two bathrooms are a great asset of the flat! Location is great too, close to the station and some shops. We were welcomed warmly and could even get in to the flat a bit earlier which was greatly appreciated. Would stay there again."
7275367,403174277,2019-01-20,115581004,Andras,"Great apartment, very clean and modern with a very friendly host. Would definitely recommend anytime."
7275367,406398778,2019-01-29,28230189,Riku,Ali's apartment was awesome for our group of 3! Spacious bedrooms and a very good kitchen at a convenient location! Also the room temperature was very pleasant even by Finnish standards and water pressure in the showers was much better than expected.
7275367,411072000,2019-02-11,109669798,Emmi,Just like described!
7275367,415329988,2019-02-22,18791512,Liao,"the kitchen is nice and the beds are comfortable. <br/>the neighbour is quiet, you can see cats walk pass by the back yard everyday."
7275367,428517396,2019-03-25,205527415,Minna,Location was near metro station.
7275367,434114091,2019-04-07,22041876,Giulio,"Ali’s apartment met our expectations, and more: it is spacious, clean, equipped with all basic needs and close to public transportation.  It fully deserves its current rating.<br/>The water boiler has seen better days but a good stainless steel pan and a powerful gas range did the trick just as well.<br/>One suggestion from a guest not accustomed to British satellite tv:  instructions on how to access a news channel (provided there was one) would have been welcome.<br/>We would definitely consider a return visit to these accommodations.  And thank you, Ali, for the beautiful yellow tulips on the dinner table!"
7275367,444015969,2019-04-27,218223696,Christian,Die Lage und Entfernung zum Zentrum und der U Bahn sind genial. Die Unterkunft entspricht dem Standard . Zum übernachten ok.

7275367,459421332,2019-05-27,13627525,Mitch,"Ali's place was great. A really convenient location, close to West Brompton tube, a few excellent coffee shops and lots of food options at The Crossing / Prince Hotel.<br/>The flat had everything we needed for a comfortable stay, and great weather meant we got to use the lovely backyard. Would highly recommend Ali's place."
7275367,588971190,2020-01-05,9914773,Frauke,"Wir waren mit zwei Paaren für vier Nächte in Ali‘s Apartment. <br/>Die Anreise von Heathrow war sehr einfach. In unmittelbarer Nähe gibt es zwei Underground Stationen. Auch sind verschiedene Restaurants, Supermarkt und ein richtig guter Pub (the Atlas)  um die Ecke. <br/>Das Apartment ist im Basement und sehr sauber, gut ausgestattet, gut geheizt und komfortabel. WLAN ist vorhanden und stabil. Die Lage ist ruhig, allerdings hört man (bei offenem Fenster) die Anflüge auf Heathrow. Es sind zwei Schlafzimmer vorhanden, jedes Schlafzimmer hat sein eigenes Bad. Ein Zimmer mit Dusche und einem 1,40 Bett, das zweite Zimmer mit 1,60 Bett und Badewanne. In der Wohnküche kann ggfs. noch ein Schlafsofa benutzt werden. <br/>Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet, inclusive einer Waschmaschine. <br/>Der Garten ist im Sommer bestimmt sehr schön zum relaxen, jetzt im Januar haben wir ihn nicht genutzt. <br/>Wir würden die Wohnung sofort wieder mieten für eine paar Tage London. Die Schlüsselübergabe war sehr unkompliziert und klappte reibungslos. Auch die Kommunikation mit Ali war ausgesprochen gut und schnell."
7275367,714689929,2020-12-11,74262921,Wing Ho,"Ali is an amazing person. the house was very clean and comfortable, we really loved the stay."
7275367,729837478,2021-02-08,137293574,Nicola,"Ali is delightful, responsive and helpful.  Excellent check-in.  The flat was actually better than expected.  Very comfortable with two equal size bedroom with their own good and modern bathrooms.  Very minor maintenance issues as with all properties but clean and comfortable with ample wardrobe space.  Good location.  Some outside furniture for the summer would be great and perhaps one day a new sofa?  But no complaints.  A great host and a nice property.  Would come back again."
7275367,753210400,2021-04-30,8930211,Johann,"Fantastic stay. Ali’s apartment is very cozy, very well located and extremely clean. Ali was a wonderful host."

Room is a good size, cozy and there is a comfortable bed. Kitchen is equipped with everything you would need. Gauthier and his roommate are great hosts, offering suggestions for places to eat (etc) and very accommodating.<br/>Would definitely stay there again and I recommend it to anyone.<br/> "

Everything we wanted to see was within reasonable walking distance and an underground station was right around the corner.<br/>There were no problems whatsoever and communication always worked flawlessly.<br/>Very recommendable for a short-trip to London!
7324287,48449766,2015-09-26,42009050,Neil,Really great host. Met me at the flat and showed me everything I needed to know. Very nice spacious room and great central location.
7324287,48574099,2015-09-27,12399335,Amber,"The flat is in a nice area where Starbucks is right across the street and lots of nice restaurants in walking distance. The tube station was within 3 mins walk. The host was very kind to keep our luggage even before the date we stayed with him. The room is as pictured, not spacious but quite enough for the purpose of exploring the city. Shared shower was just a little not so convenience since there were 4 ppl (us included) in the flat. Overall is was a very good experience staying there."
7324287,49069426,2015-09-30,9165282,Richard,The room was very close to the location where I had my meeting. A bit noisy and small though. I did not really have a chance to meet the hosts since I arrived quite late.<br/><br/> 
7324287,50461176,2015-10-12,41770836,Luciano,"Gracias Gauthier y compañero x su hospitalidad y amabilidad<br/><br/>abrazo, Luciao y Felipe"
7324287,51922647,2015-10-25,44117206,Karen,Everything was just as expected from the listing. We had a marvelous experience and appreciate the hospitality. Look forward to airbnb reservations the next time.

7324287,54179063,2015-11-16,11227516,Hedi,"Nous avons très bien été accueillis. On se sent tout de suite à l'aise avec Gauthier qui est très bien renseigné sur l'actualité culturelle (events) de Londres.<br/>L'appartement correspond parfaitement aux photos. C'est très propre.

Loro sono molto disponibili a venirti incontro per qualsiasi esigenza! Fantastico aver trovato in cucina una Moka con caffè italiano!!<br/>La posizione è fantastica, a pochi metri dall'underground. <br/>Unico inconveniente, plausibile per una posizione in centro città, sono gli schiamazzi che arrivano fino a tarda notte dalla strada sottostante: attrezzarsi con tappi auricolari per chi ha il sonno (Website hidden by Airbnb) ne vale la pena per un soggiorno per visitare Londra: risparmio di tempo e di denaro evitando lunghi spostamenti!"
7324287,59911666,2016-01-17,14528074,Alice,"Gauthier est très sympa, l'appartement est propre et très bien placé (juste à côté du métro, plein d'arrêts de bus, juste à côté de Picadilly circus, on peut faire beaucoup de choses à pied). Par contre la chambre est très bruyante (quartier fêtard + vieilles fenêtres) : vraiment très dur de dormir sans de très bonnes boules quies."
7324287,63900042,2016-02-28,594135,Renate,"alles entsprach genau den Beschreibungen, sehr  zuvorkommende und hilfsbereite Gastgeber.  Alles behaglich eingerichtet.  Hab mich sehr wohl gefühlt,  würde jederzeit wieder buchen."

7324287,69065820,2016-04-09,21837770,Morgane,"Excellent accueil ! Gauthier est ultra disponible pour tout renseignement et toujours prêt à aider.<br/>La chambre est confortable et spacieuse et tout est très propre.<br/>L'appartement est très bien situé. On peut donc se déplacer énormément à pieds, il est très facile de sortir le soir et il y a plusieurs ligne de métro qui passent à proximité. Avec les multiples avantages du centre va aussi un petit inconvénient, c'est assez bruyant. Mais une paire de boules quies pour les sommeils sensibles suffit à régler le désagrément. "

7428524,88393121,2016-07-24,26809084,Mark,My parents stayed for 2 nights in this lovely flat. Emma made us feel welcome by setting the table and leaving breakfast. The flat is nicely decorated with art and old furniture and lovely garden with catches the sun throught the day. The flat is located on one of the nicest quiet squares in London. There are many cafes within 1 min walk and 3 parks all within 15min.  
7613234,44855073,2015-08-29,41655273,John,"Andrea was a brilliant host. I had to work late on the Monday and arrived late but Andrea was more than accommodating. The flat is about a five minute work from Tulse Hill Station and is therefore ideally placed for commuting around London.<br/>The flat itself is great and exactly as its described in the website. The decor is modern and the shower and kitchen come with great 'facilities'.<br/>The room itself is spacious, very clean (as is the whole flat) and the bed us very comfortable.<br/>Andrea was a brilliant host who is chatty and friendly.<br/>She was happy to give advice about the area and tips on commuting etc.  <br/>This was my first Airbnb stay and I couldn't have asked for a better place/host."
7613234,45448379,2015-09-02,28661409,Pieter,Andrea was an absolute delight. We felt really welcome and at home. It's a beautiful flat. We would highly recommend staying there!
7613234,49337108,2015-10-03,20031457,Paul,"Booking a place for one month is not always easy, as questions remain: are we going to get on well with the host? is the place like on the photos? how is the neighbourhood?<br/><br/>When I arrived, all my questions quickly vanished: Andrea is very friendly, she gave me all the information I could need and indicated where the good places around were. Tulse Hill train station is very close, from there you can easily go to Elephant & Castle, Brixton or Luton Airport.<br/><br/>The flat is just like on the photos: clean, tidy, bright and modern. If you like cats, you’d probably get on well with Phoebe, Andrea’s cat.<br/><br/>The most important part: I felt at home and that’s probably the best quality for any place!<br/>Thanks again Andrea! :)"
7613234,49793446,2015-10-06,11359746,Azeela,Beautiful home with convenient access to Central London! I highly recommend this to anyone who's visiting London. Andrea's really nice and helpful.

7613234,50051490,2015-10-08,16178416,Chris,"Andrea was so welcoming and friendly and made me feel at home straight away. She showed me where everything was, gave me the wifi code and even handed me an oyster card to help me get around the city.<br/><br/>The Apartment was amazing, just as you see in the picture if not better than expected. It had everything I needed and more and was very comfortable and homely. Free parking on the street and only a short walk to the nearest train station to quickly get me into the centre if the city.<br/><br/>I can't wait to visit the area again so I can go back and stay."

Her place is exactly  as pictured - very comfortable and homey!  The Tube station is about a five minute walk and very easy to get to.  We had a wonderful time and would definitely stay there again next time we are in London !!"

The flat is massive by London standards and beautifully decorated, the perfect place to chill out and super close to some amazing Brixton eats. Close to the train and a short bus ride away from the Brixton station tube station. Thanks so much for an awesome stay Andrea, loved meeting you and your cute cat Phoebe! "
7613234,55326074,2015-11-29,7672549,Jason,"Had a great time at Andreas place. Good location, really cool interior design, a comfy bed and a friendly cat. Andrea is really helpful and friendly and we would defo recommend staying here."
7613234,55836493,2015-12-06,49496158,Andrew,"Andrea is helpful and welcoming.  She provides oyster cards for public transport, and a useful printed guide to local transport and amenities. The flat is modern, comfortable and very clean.  The room is to the front side of the house and there can be some traffic noise from around 6am.  Venetian blinds don't block out street lights all that effectively, probably only a country-dweller like me would find this a drawback.  Otherwise the flat is quiet and has a calm atmosphere.  I would certainly return."
7613234,58710306,2016-01-03,50332774,Brittany,"Andrea was very kind and chill with everything. The place is amazing- modern bathroom and kitchen, clean and artistic room. I would definitely recommend this place to ppl visiting London."

Extremely easy to communicate with and always willing to help out!<br/>The flat is lovely and provides a great base to explore central London and wonderful, vibrant Hackney. <br/>We found the flat to be clean, spacious and bright.

7862460,61164963,2016-02-01,30726649,Ana,"Our days in Holly´s house have been great. Her house is even bigger that what you spect in the pictures, is warm, conformable and you feel like at home. The house has a lot of light, have everything you need. She live us spare sheet and towels, a new soapier shower, and things for breakfast, even fresh bread. She also give us a paper with all the instructions to make work the TV, the heater,places near the house.

The flat is very cosy and has everything you'd want for a nice night in. A good sized kitchen (with delicious homemade bread), a great sofa and a big television with loads of channels. It's pretty easy to get as well, walking distance from Clapton Station. We would highly recommend staying at Holly's flat as she will ensure for a very relaxing stay. "
7862460,63262607,2016-02-21,35331087,Gent,Had a great time in this lovely flat. Had everything we could possibly need and more. Breakfast was left for us which was a very nice touch. Holly was very helpful whenever needed! 
7862460,63282407,2016-02-21,24999806,Ying,"We did a photoshop in Holly's house. Holly is sooooo lovely and friendly and helpful and made us tea and breakfast. She was literally the best host I have ever met and if you come to London, you really should visit her house. We had a very nice short stay in her house and her house is absolutely beautiful, especially the kitchen and living room. The house is clean and quiet, and decorated with plants and flowers. ^^"

There is the large Springfield park close-by which has a canal and very pleasant walks. The nearest tube / overground is a 15 minute walk away or a 5 minute bus ride.

It has a balcony overlooking a play area, and sitting at the kitchen table for breakfast, I was looking at autumnal trees - a rare view from London flats. The apartment was really spacious, well laid out and with a wonderful air of calm. The kitchen was fully equipped, I loved the selection of individual china mugs. Holly very thoughtfully had supplied eggs and bread, milk and juice which was such a sweet touch. The bathroom was big and had natural light from a big window. The bed was super comfortable! Communication with Holly was easy and superb, she gave me instructions how to find the flat and about local transport. Her apartment was the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed in! It’s the sort of place you dream of living in! The location was ideal for me as I have family living nearby and the walk to Stoke Newington with all its shops and restaurants didn’t take long. I would love to stay again! Thank you so much, Holly!"

7949930,144012065,2017-04-14,42300408,Alana,Sue and Gareth are warm and welcoming! Beautiful and warm home with a cute garden out back. Sue was so helpful about giving tips and advise about places to see and explore. She went above and beyond to make it one of our favorite airbnb experiences. Super close to main bus and train transportation. Cute cafes near by. Quiet residential area. Highly recommended!

7949930,149847420,2017-05-06,16434948,Kristina,"I don't even know where to start. Staying with Sue and Gareth was just amazing. Sue is so warm, kind and helpful and it was a pleasure to spend time with her. Having to meet her was one of the reasons our trip was so amazing.<br/><br/>The room is as described and like in the photos. It is a cosy room overlooking the garden with access to a shared big and light bathroom. Sue was very kind to let us use the kitchen for coffee and light breakfast.<br/><br/>Other than our kind hosts, the thing we liked the most about their place is the location. Both the neighbourhood and how it is close/well connected to central London. The house is located in a very safe and quiet neighbourhood. East Dulwich is a place that has its own life and you can stroll around Lordship Lane where some very nice places to eat are. Also, just around the corner of Sue’s place is a nice park and a big supermarket. The overground train is literary just around the corner (less than 2 minutes from the house) and the train will take you to London Bridge station in about 15 minutes and it departs about every 15-20 minutes. There are also three bus lines a minute away that depart every few minutes and will take you downtown (or uptown :) in 30-40 minutes of a nice sightseeing ride.<br/><br/>If somebody wondered about the cat, Freddy is an old cat that really just minds his own business and is very peaceful. Most of the time his either in the garden or sleeping in his chair.<br/><br/>All in all this was more than a pleasant stay and thank you, Sue.<br/>"
7949930,155645243,2017-05-28,75310151,Hana,It was a long bus ride to city centre but you only need one bus and it comes frequently. Bathroom was very nice. Sue provides excellent suggestions.  
7949930,160706099,2017-06-15,1113951,John,"Sue and Gareth were very friendly and made me feel welcome in their house.

7949930,191431982,2017-09-07,1113951,John,"Second time at Sue's place. It felt like returning to see old friends rather than staying in a B&B. Sue and her husband are very welcoming, easy-going and chatty. The house and guest room are relaxed and peaceful, but the bustle of East Dulwich is just around the corner. An excellent place to stay in South London."

Perfect to recharge your batteries after a stroll through the busy parts of London. Thanks again Sue and Gareth!"

Sue gave us all the informations and instructions to get to the airbnb from the airport and gave us a warm welcome. The room is quiet and has a nice view over the garden, just as described. There are busses at a 2 min walk from the appartment which take you to the center. Thanks a lot!"
7949930,253133225,2018-04-13,13199805,Jason,Sue was incredibly welcoming! Her house in East Dulwich is incredibly clean and tidy. The location is excellent right next to the train station and with a close distance to restaurants. Thank you!!
7949930,256159336,2018-04-22,96932291,Samy,"I booked Sue's place when I had relatives visiting me, and Sue and her partner made them feel very comfortable in the place. It was very tidy and had a lovely garden!"
7949930,259026962,2018-04-30,172685942,Apollonia T.,"Sue was a lovely host. We thoroughly enjoyed the three nights we stayed with her.  Upon arrival she immediately stroke up a conversation with us and - accompanied by a lovely cup of tea - we talked about the arts, London, people, well, pretty much anything that came to mind. In addition to that we very much enjoyed the beautiful exhibits of her glass art which her house is embellished with. Since - as they say- one meets everyone a second time around, we’re certainly looking forward to meeting you again, Sue. All the best, Apollonia and Martin"
7949930,275930024,2018-06-12,10370057,Kulsoom,"Sue and Gareth's home is very quiet, comfortable and pleasant. They were very patient and understanding with us in the face of travel delays, and made us feel very welcome throughout - thank you both for your hospitality :-) The Dulwich area has lots to do and see, and is worth visiting in its own right, though the attractions of London are easy to reach by bus or train. Highly recommended!"
7949930,286961087,2018-07-07,193554472,Krishna,"My stay with Sue was absolutely wonderful! My friend and I arrived and Sue had everything already prepared for us. She not only offered advice on how best to plan our journey and visit using public transport, but also what are some of the best tourist and non-tourist sights to see. Both her and her husband were very welcoming and made us feel comfortable in her home. Speaking of her home, it is in Dulwich which has plenty of places to eat and drink. It also is right near a bus stop with several buses and an overground train station to the heart of London. I hope anyone who comes to Sue's home has the same wonderful stay I did!"
7949930,291756198,2018-07-16,29917561,Sonja,Sue and Gareth are a very easygoing  and uncomplicated couple who do all they can to help smooth your way for an enjoyable stay in London. Sue's paintings and her coloured glass panels all around the house and in the garden give a special illumination to the tasteful decoration and add a special flair to the ambience of their beautifully appointed home that is a pleasure to share.
7949930,303341092,2018-08-07,25431494,Kevin,"Sue was a fantastic host - kind, attentive and helpful. The room was perfect for a couple, and we had breakfast in the lovely garden space which was a treat. You can get into central London quite easily on the bus.

Sue and Gareth were great; really welcoming, interesting, easy going, and fun. A wonderfully quiet, charming, and spacious bedroom where you awake to a view of just trees, gardens, and the little birds on the feeder. A lovely big bathroom with a really good hot shower. Art everywhere throughout the house including some gorgeous and magical glass creations that even cascade rainbows on to the floor at times when the sun shines. It was perfect. "

The flat easily accommodated our party of four and the bedrooms were of a good size.<br/>The location was fantastic, just a few minutes away from the shops and Brixton tube station. Really good value for money on a centrally located two bedroom flat. We would definitely stay again. "

James n'était pas présent à notre arrivé, mais un ami nous a accueilli à la station Brixton et nous y a conduit. L'appartement était propre et le quartier correct, bien que bruyant (même avec les fenêtres fermées!). Situé au 4e étage, pas d'ascenseur, donc pour les grosses valises, prendre une pause sur les paliers :)"

We've been received by a friend of Arthur, Quinton, a very nice personne who took the time to explain everything about the place, and activity to do in London! Quinton had buy some food for us, bread, cookies,cake & milk for breakfast, so lovely and kind attention. The flat was perfect for what we were doing for a few days . It's near the Homerton station so easy to access ! There were too adorable little cats wainting for cuddling and loving, very sociable ! If you want to spend a moment in London, to visite, and juste to sleep well in a nice DJ flat, well, that's the place ! I would definitly come back in that flat if I come back one day in London. "

8480006,226217829,2018-01-09,31766511,Toni,"This place is great! Steps away from excellent shopping, many dining options, and super close to Liverpool station- it was exactly what I needed for my quick business trip to London! My host, A, was very thoughtful and even though they were on their own trip, made sure to check in with me regularly about how things were going and if I was comfortable in their space. The location made it just secluded enough to be quiet and not bothered by the noise on the main street . Highly recommend checking this spot out for a fun and funky little home for your next London getaway."
8480006,227293883,2018-01-14,60626823,Katie,Really enjoyed our stay at this air bnb. We stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed wandering around Shoreditch and taking an easy underground route into the very centre of london. Would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone. Really great host!

8480006,277445239,2018-06-16,8563601,Laurent,"Wonderful place to stay in one of London's most exciting neighbourhood. The flat was larger than I expected. First floor with a small outdoor space, quiet street, comfortable bed, near all services... you don't really need more than that. To top it off, the host is incredibly responsive and welcoming."

8480006,287467095,2018-07-08,389663,Iskander,"Great experience in the apartment of Alex. The apartment is compact but spacious enough for a solo traveler as I was, and also for a couple, I'm sure. As the pictures very well show you will stay in a apartment with a lot of style and identity, it is not an anonymous place, which I think is great. <br/><br/>Alex was very responsive and gave lots of tips before and during the stay via chat. <br/><br/>And the location is great, in the heart of Shoreditch, nearby two subway stations."

8480006,345852701,2018-11-06,78932667,Desiree,"Location is excellent. Plenty to do, eat and see just around the corner.<br/><br/>Host communicated often and responded immediately to any queries.<br/><br/>However, if you suffer from asthma or dust allergies, this is not the right place for you. The house has been cleaned, yes,  but there are a lot of trinkets and collections around that catch dust. Found myself sneezing and rubbing eyes and using my inhaler when in the house for any period of time. I feel awful leaving a less than perfect review, but feel it would be irresponsible not to given how much the dust affected our stay."

8480006,411992148,2019-02-14,33732431,Scott,"This was what Airbnb is all about - linking up a great space in a great city with great people.  I was in a jam and needed a place fairly last minute (like hours)  and stumbled upon this gem.  Although it was most definitely last minute and A&M was unavailable at that minute to check me in - she completely sorted out my situation and got me in.  She was massively resourceful and communicative.  When you meet folks like A&M that care so much, it’s a truly wonderful experience.  I would give this place 10 stars out of 5 ⭐️ !"
8480006,436083329,2019-04-12,14036285,Valerio,"TOP HOST!!! It was amazing to meet Alex. I went to her flat with my girlfriend and we enjoyed a lot to have an entire flat for us.<br/>This is a really big flat, it's NOT a studio!! It was super clean, homey and it was such nicely decorated! <3<br/>What about location?? 10 minutes walking from Liverpool St!! Yes, WALKING!!! I didn't find a better one!!<br/>Alex gave us tons of tips that we kept for all of our trip in london, she's super friendly so..<br/>BOOK IT! BOOK IT! BOOK IT! :)<br/>Can't wait to come back!"
8480006,441940735,2019-04-22,19518912,Leigh,Wonderful experience! This location is top notch in a great part of town. Very local to many attractions. Shoreditch is the funnest neighborhood in London hands down. Our host went above and beyond to communicate with us so that we were sure not to have any issues during our stay. Highly recommend!
8480006,443618406,2019-04-26,12499338,Warrick,"Nice place, very colourful with interesting posters and art around the house.  Bread, milk, tea and coffee provided was a thoughtful touch. Host provided loads of tips for going out in the area."
8480006,472342686,2019-06-19,34756374,Gabor,Absolutely great place. Alex was a perfect host - offered up a ton of great recommendations and was incredibly communicative throughout. Spent a week there after some work in the UK and was an ideal place to rest/relax and see some sights and eat/drink at solid locations. Highly recommend!
8480006,473334583,2019-06-21,22459605,Alex,Easy and simple all way through with a very communicative host and great location. Thanks! :)
8480006,475470748,2019-06-24,24274344,Chris,"Short version: I wish my place was as cool as this.<br/><br/>To say I loved staying in Alex’s flat would be majorly underselling it. There is a homeyness to the place that immediately draws you in. It feels like you’re popping over to see a friend; warm in a way that’s familiar and comfortable from the moment you step inside.  <br/><br/>I’m a big fan of places with character and the apartment's got it in abundance. Incredibly fun and vibrant, it has an energy that couldn’t be a more perfect complement to the surrounding neighborhood. And that neighborhood is fantastic. It’s only a couple blocks away from Brick Lane, overflowing with all sorts of cool restaurants, boutiques, vintage shops, etc. One of the main reasons I chose to stay in that area was to check out the amazing street art, and it was like I was walking through an endless museum every time I went out to explore the city. You’ll never lack for things to do or see around the apartment. <br/><br/>And best of all, Alex was an absolutely perfect host. Attentive and communicative, Alex made sure I had whatever I needed from before I arrived until I left to head home - everything from providing fantastic directions for how to get to the apartment, checking in when I was en route to make sure I was finding my way alright, and answering any questions I had while I was there almost as soon as I’d texted them.<br/><br/>I can’t recommend Alex’s apartment enough and can’t wait for my next trip to London since I won’t have to worry about finding a great place to stay!"
8480006,478984848,2019-06-30,27678645,Phoebe,Great cosy place to stay. Location was right in the buzzing Shoreditch. Host was very responsive with communication and gave handy local tips.

Would highly recommend if you’ve never travelled to London before as I felt 100% at ease. Great location right next to a Tesco and local bars and restaurants. Will be staying again.

Some light breakfast foods was a nice touch too! I really enjoyed how central this was to all of Shoreditch and Hoxton - super walkable and safe area with lots of amazing street art. Also close to tons of outdoor markets and incredible restaurants/bars (5 min walk to Dishoom)!<br/>Highly recommend!
8480006,560924418,2019-11-08,79567647,Steve,Great Host!
8480006,562714899,2019-11-11,85970810,Michael,"Good place, and quick responses.  Decoration could likely use an upgrade."
8480006,571564785,2019-12-01,1514700,Amulya,Great location and a really comfy place. Having milk and coffee sorted along with a breakfast was great. Would stay here again next time we visit.
8480006,574383152,2019-12-08,20164445,Benoit,Perfect location for this very well decorated appartment. The landlord was prompt to answer all your questions and shared some good tips to make the journey even better.
8480006,580856252,2019-12-23,252851247,Talea,This location is amazing! So much to see and do right around the flat. There is really awesome street art and markets literally steps from the front door. Alex was always very responsive if I had any questions. I highly recommend this place
8480006,585828549,2020-01-01,144405494,Joel,"Horrendous experience from start to finish, the apartment description is extremely misleading and states (at time of writing) that free parking is available on the premises which it isn't. The outside was horrendously graffitied which made the place look very unwelcoming and had bars on all the windows. The hallway looked like that of a dirty hostel and had clearly not been cleaned in months. There was stale and moldy bread left out on the side along with several half eaten sweets left around the living room. The fridge had a draw in it full of gone off cheese and as soon as the fridge was opened the whole apartment smelled even worse. The wardrobes where tied up with cable ties and there was nowhere to put your clothes. The bedroom had a mixture of children's Teddy bears and lots of images of naked women on the walls (very confusing). The whole place was flithy and very unhygenic you honestly would not want to sleep in this place, we left within an hour or so and got a very nice hotel room instead which was a lot cheaper than this top off. The host when contacted about these issues was rude, unhelpful AND argumentative. She does not deserve to be hosting on Air Bnb, AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
8480006,594910197,2020-01-19,112900872,Graham,"My expectations were exceeded in every sense. I was a bit concerned by a previous poor review, but that seemed inconsistent with other guests' experience, so I thought maybe I should ignore that as being one of those things. I was right to think that way. Alex was super efficient and clear in her communications and the flat itself is in a really convenient location for transport, dining, shopping, culture and entertainment. The flat was clean and tidy (albeit it is Alex's home, so it holds her possessions - for example, the bathroom is full of products) and well equipped.  Everything I needed worked, the bed (comfy), the fridge (cold), the heating (warm), the shower (warm and wet), the oven (hot), the hob (flames), pots, pans, crockery and cutlery all available. You get the picture - it was great!"
8480006,607102741,2020-02-17,11673580,Tyler,"A spectacular location to explore London from. Right around the corner from Brick Lane with a wide variety of stores and food, and down the street from the fun and nightlife of Shoreditch.  Would highly recommend and will definitely stay again when in England next."
8480006,614190544,2020-03-04,63536772,Marta,"The place has lots of personality and the location is perfect to travel to different areas of London. Walking distance to Shoreditch, great for restaurants, bar and clubs.<br/>The place itself was clean and the host was great! Alex made sure I had all I needed and kept in touch throughout my stay in case I needed anything.<br/>Highly recommended!!!"
8480006,650049212,2020-08-12,98970518,Savvas,"Great flat, short walking distance to local markets."
8480006,504136958860024511,2021-11-26,119567699,Sapir,"I stayed at Alex’s place for eleven nights and it was absolutely great!<br/>It’s as close as can be to Brick Lane, and a ten minutes walk to public transportation that can take you anywhere. The flat itself is very convenient, with proper heating and a nice kitchen, and despite the main location it’s very quiet!<br/>Gabriela the cleaner was super sweet and helped for a smooth check in, and despite Alex being away at a very different time zone, she was available and helpful.<br/>One thing to note is that although the flat is very close to main streets, there can be a minute or two of walking in alleyways/side streets, where alone at night it’s sometimes uncomfortable. Once getting used to the area I was able to avoid those ways.<br/>I would definitely recommend Alex’s place (particularly if you have any business in that area of London).<br/>Thank you very much for a wonderful stay!"
8494414,52131727,2015-10-26,41702413,Sebastiaan,"We stayed one full week in Dan's house in Richmond with our family of 5. We do not need a lot of words to describe how it was: we loved it, Dan's house is beautiful, Richmond is fantastic. We would have no problem staying a lot longer!<br/><br/>This is indeed a great house for people who love art but also interior design, architecture, gardens and nature while being very close to the big city. It is a precious gift to have the opportunity to cook in Dan's kitchen while overlooking the garden. <br/><br/>Richmond is a beautiful town (so much nicer than we ever imagined!) and has everything you need: lots of shops, nice pubs, restaurants and a fantastic park. Its only problem is the house prices.....otherwise we would move there tomorrow!<br/><br/>"
8494414,53067882,2015-11-04,28236366,Till,"Dan's Haus liegt in einem ruhigen, schönen Teil von Richmond, etwa 10 min von der U-Bahn entfernt. Es bietet viel Platz (mehr als wir nutzen konnten!), ist praktisch und geschmackvoll eingerichtet und vor allem hat es durch Dan's Bilder eine ganz persönliche und tolle Atmosphäre. Dan selbst hat sich - obwohl in USA - unglaublich nett um uns gekümmert und die Schlüsselübergabe reibungslos organisiert. Insgesamt war das eine tolle Erfahrung und wir würden jederzeit wieder kommen."
8494414,53848341,2015-11-13,10327928,Sam,"We really enjoyed a lot in Dan's beautiful house, cooking, reading, hosting our friends  a home made dinner, living and experiencing, just like local people.<br/>The house is very nice decorated, not only beautiful, but also very user friendly. And yes, we like the kitchen with big window and full equipment inside mostly, very convenient, and very comfortable.<br/>Also we are very impressed by Dan's painting in his house, most of them are with very bright and strong colour, we can feel that Dan must be a people who has great talent t and passion as well.<br/>It's a pity we haven't met Dan personally this time, however, his quick respond speed, his warm welcome notice, makes us feel he is just nearby. We are very lucky to have stayed there, we would love to be back again."
8494414,54926590,2015-11-25,35010863,Chris,"Dan was the perfect host, although not being around he was in touch to make sure everything was perfect, we were very welcome in a beautiful area of Richmond, a great experience, thanks Dan."
8494414,56596414,2015-12-15,19086099,Kate,"We loved our stay at Dan's home in Richmond. Great location, classic London style house, gorgeous kitchen, nice bathrooms. A welcoming and warm place to stay. Thank you. We would definitely stay again. Dan was a pleasure to communicate with and everything was well organised and ready for us."
8494414,58852122,2016-01-05,48130517,Ian,"This was our first experience using Air BnB.  Everything about the experience with Dan was fantastic.  His house is big and spacious and was excellent for our family of 2 adults and 3 children - kids had room to play and watch TV upstairs while adults entertained downstairs.  Having 8 dining room chairs meant we could invite friends and parents around for dinners....and the kitchen is a joy to cook in.<br/><br/>The house is covered from top to bottom in Dan's wonderful paintings - they make the stay all the more interesting and memorable.<br/><br/>The location is about 10 mins walk or less from the centre of Richmond which is extremely convenient for shops and the train station.  At the top of Dan's street (1 minute walk) is an Oddbins (off licence), a pub and a very good bakery.<br/><br/>The speed of Dan's response to email queries once we arrived at the house was fantastic (but if he's in Boston don't expect such a quick response if you email him at 8am!) - it was very comforting to know that he was almost instantly contactable in the event we needed anything - and we only had a couple of very minor queries.<br/><br/>The street is very quiet and peaceful and we never once had any disturbance from anywhere.<br/><br/>Parking is possible but a bit restricted - ok for a few hours stay on a pay and display but harder for longer stays as it's mostly parking for residents.  We arrived by rental car but got rid of it straight away.  Frankly, you don't need a car here or anywhere in London  - much easier to walk, take public transport...or sometimes a short taxi ride.<br/><br/>Richmond is the most beautiful part of London - almost like being in the country but 16 minutes to Waterloo station on the fast train.<br/><br/>All in all, the stay was the highlight of our trip to London and Dan a superb host. <br/>"
8494414,61929076,2016-02-09,5087075,Sara,Excellent host with fast response and beautiful house in a lovely Richmond location on the hill. Perfect for our family of four.  Would definitely like to use again. 
8494414,64633258,2016-03-06,25475606,Brian,"Beautiful house, lovely high ceilings and so nice to be surrounded by Dans amazing artwork. Really close to Richmond town and all the parks, loved it"
8494414,70444937,2016-04-17,55758585,Sandra,"A beautiful place in a lovely neighbourhood with a fantastic garden! Dan offers his guest a very personal stay and you easily feel almost like home. The house is spacious, quiet and very British indeed. Enjoyed it very much!"
8494414,71895665,2016-04-29,61853837,Ronel,"We booked Number 15 Onslow Road with a view to it being – after a long tour of Europe – our relaxing English stay-over for a few days before returning home on the long flight back to Australia.  <br/><br/>After a long trip there is nothing like a warm and welcoming home in which to spend a few days recharging batteries. <br/>Number 15 Onslow Road most certainly was that.  And so much more.<br/><br/>It is a most substantial home: spacious and sunny with large windows allowing a view of the charming streetscape in the front as well as a delightful English garden in the back.  The home is more than large enough in which individual family members might lose themselves with a good book or amble from room to room contemplating the ubiquitously colourful artworks adorning almost every available wall space. Deliciously eclectic.<br/><br/>The rooms are cosy and the beds very comfortable. Bathrooms are modern and spotlessly clean. The fully-equipped, modern kitchen provides a happy locale for throwing together a salad or making a quick meal when a break from eating out is needed. <br/><br/>And then there’s the peace and quiet of the neighbourhood. Perfect for the noise-averse traveller.  <br/>Nothing more than the sound of birdsong in the mornings and the gentle cooing of the rock doves in the afternoon.  <br/><br/>Not that Richmond is a sleepy hollow by any measure: just a stroll away down quaint streets lined with manicured London suburbia or through squirrel-inhabited gardens, one comes across the picturesque Thames and its pretty walkways, adjoined in the Richmond vicinity by many world-class pubs, cafes and restaurants.  And then just a block from the river the pretty and colourful high street of Richmond twists and turns past all manner of shopping venues: clothes, fresh food, groceries, financial services… Richmond town centre offers all the things to be found in any large city, but retains the quintessential English village feel. <br/><br/>15 Onslow Road provided the perfect balance between serenity and activity.<br/><br/>And Dan is a most engaging and responsive host, communicating clearly and often.<br/><br/>At the end of a long international trip, one is almost always looking forward to getting home and back to normal routine.<br/><br/>But 15 Onslow Road made us feel totally different. <br/>It made us want to stay a few days longer... a veritable home away from home.<br/><br/>And there aren’t too many places about which one can truly say that.      <br/>"
8494414,73455977,2016-05-08,31391615,Sebastian,"A really beautiful stay in Richmond, everything was perfectly arranged by Dan our host. It is really a place to relax in Richmond very quiet and also central. "
8494414,81525394,2016-06-23,30286902,Melonie,"Dan was amazing.  He communicated consistently and with such kindness.  We loved the art and the beauty of his home.  We loved the books, the colors, the coziness and warmth.  If you stay here, know that you it is about 12-15 minute walk to Richmond station and then about 30 minutes into Central London.  If you are focused on Richmond, this is THE home to rent. Dan is fantastic to work with and we found the home easily.  He provided visitors passes for our rental car.  He left us money in case his washer didn't work. (It did!). Great host and home."
8494414,99240385,2016-09-04,19086099,Kate,We had a great stay at Dan's home. This was our second stay. We love the location on the top of Richmond Hill. The garden is beautiful and we enjoyed sitting outside for dinner. Dan is very friendly and helpful. He communicates very quickly and is a delight to deal with. Thank you Dan!
8494414,101109282,2016-09-11,22923221,Per Arne,A very nice stay in a house with great soul. Richmond is a pearl with shops and restaurants. No need to go to the city every day. Kew Gardens near by and lovely walking along the river. Dan is very responsive and helpful.
8494414,102970345,2016-09-19,17236017,Wasseem,"Dan was a wonderful host. He was always available and I felt reassured and supported from when I began the booking process to when I vacated. <br/><br/>Dan's home is lovely. We were more than happy to come home after a day  spent in Richmond. He has a well equipped and stylish kitchen, beautiful garden, and more generally there is plenty of room to relax. <br/><br/>If I go back to Richmond I would definitely stay at Dan's home. "
8494414,104927205,2016-09-29,36923896,Krystel,Dan's place is beautiful. The art work is impressive and the property is very well equipped. Our family found it easy to stay there and it has all the home comforts you might need.<br/>Dan is very accommodating as a host and replied quickly to our questions.<br/>Hopefully we will have an opportunity of staying there again!
8494414,108169990,2016-10-14,15146232,Gillian,"We had a wonderful five nights at Dan's house. It's a large house, very comfortably furnished in an English style. Loads of light and sun coming into the kitchen and dining room. We had our bedroom window open each night and it was amazingly quiet. Great local shopping and we walked every day in the Park. The house is in a fabulous location, with excellent train and tube services."
8494414,110568631,2016-10-27,1332740,Dennis,"Dan is one cool cat. Even though he was in the US the week we stayed in his home, he was always accessible through Facetime. <br/><br/>We liked Dan's home very much. It was cosy, cool. you could feel the history in every inch of the house. <br/><br/>I was staying in his home with my extended family. We all had a great time chilling, eating in the living room and cooking if needed be. <br/><br/>The only little problem was parking, but I solved that by parking 10 minutes away from the house where parking was free. <br/><br/>Dan had quite a lot of his own stuff in the house and he left them there to be used by his guests.<br/><br/>Sonos sound system with Bang & Olufsen CD player was a nice touch. <br/>I recommend anyone to come and stay in his beautiful home. "
8494414,111351237,2016-10-30,44498978,Sophie,This house in Richmond was the perfect place to host a weekend away discovering a quieter part of London. Dan kept us well informed at every stage of the booking and arrival process which made it so easy. <br/><br/>The house is beautiful with art adorning every walls - really quite unique. I would highly recommend a stay here.<br/><br/>Many thanks Dan
8494414,115659977,2016-11-26,40151018,Diane,"Dan was very responsive to every question.  He reached out to us to insure we had the information we needed for our arrival.  He also left really helpful notes on both his place and the surrounding area.   True to the listing - his home is large and lovely.  The street is a very pretty, quaint and quiet.  The location is perfect!  Just around the corner are cafes and pubs and its just a quick walk to the train station.  We were able to easily venture to a different London neighborhood each day and return every evening to our sanctuary - Dan's home.  We would definitely stay here again!"
8494414,126333176,2017-01-10,68756023,Stephen,"We thoroughly recommend Dan and his house. The location was fantastic with easy access to central London by rail. My family of 6 was very comfortable in the house and we loved the Richmond location. Close to the High Street , Park and river.   "
8494414,130280445,2017-02-05,69017903,Jeff,"15 Onslow Road has an amazing location on Richmond Hill, and within 10 mins walk of almost everything including the town centre and station with numerous transport options. Also within 10mins walk of Richmond park, as is the River and has local amenities 2 mins walk from the front door including a great bakery, small but well stocked local supermarket and a couple of dining options includingThe Marlborough Pub.<br/><br/>Dan was always very courteous and incredibly quick to reply to all our communications prior to our stay as well as cater for our needs for when we arrived. He even arranged for us to park our car on a neighbours drive for our stay which we found to be a very nice gesture. <br/><br/>The house has a nice feel with turn of the century character and a lot of his own art work hanging on the walls. The lack of TV in the living areas made for a nice change and the floor to ceiling windows in the dining room over looked a very nice garden area.<br/><br/>"
8494414,145164121,2017-04-17,121505982,Cynthia,You will not regret booking your stay at Dan's lovely home in gorgeous Richmond.
8494414,148686113,2017-05-01,109619444,Robyn,A spacious and beautiful home in a great location. We spent a weekend in Richmond and we were able to walk everywhere. The house is fully equiped to eat in if that's your preference with a lovely dining room. Dan was in touch and very easy to get hold of re any questions we had. We had a fantastic weekend and I cannot recommend Dan's home more highly.
8494414,150245073,2017-05-07,122869997,Arun,"Stayed at Dan's place in Richmond for a total of 5 days. What an absolutely fantastic house ! The location is right next to Richmond park and a 10 min walk to the train station. The center of town is literally a 5 minute walk. Dan was super responsive to all questions and the stay was very memorable ! If you like art (and saying that Dan is prolific is an understatement) and want a convenient location, this is tough to beat. "

We spent a week in Dan's home and felt welcome.  By the end, we had trouble with the idea that we had to leave.  <br/><br/>We were 5 adults and 2 children.  We all slept comfortably with 2 adults in the the master with one child on the floor.  1 adult in the second bedroom on the top floor and 2 adults and one child in the 3rd bedroom on the second floor.  <br/><br/>The kitchen was the main reason for wanting an Airbnb over staying in a hotel.  We utilized the kitchen for coffee and breakfast but made our way to the many local eateries for lunch and dinner.  <br/><br/>Dan was a great host.  Responsive before we arrived.  Helpful via email while we were there.  Our first Airbnb abroad was an amazing experience.   <br/><br/>Thanks for everything Dan!  We'll be back next year!<br/>"

We appreciated the little things, such as a fully equipped kitchen, comfortable beds and pillows, WiFi, ample hot water for showers and bath, smooth check in and check out, use of washer & dryer, and prompt communication before, during and after our stay. The home is beyond lovely! I would recommend this home to a friend."

Kew Gardens and Twickenham just down the road. <br/><br/>The kitchen was well stocked and ample fridge space for home meals. <br/><br/>This is in a great part of London. Dan was easy to deal with and replied very quickly when we had any questions. Would definitely boom again if back in the area. <br/><br/>Thanks Dan."

Its situated in one of the best locations in Richmond, close to the park and some iconic spots. The house as described is for Art lovers, every inch of every wall covered with vibrant pieces. The bedrooms and living spaces are substantial with the kitchen well stocked. Richmond Hill village has everything you need and Richmond itself is a short walk should you want more (including fast trains to London). Highly recommend you choose Dan's house, we're already looking forward to our next visit! <br/><br/>Cheers, Dave and Ally"
8494414,415652889,2019-02-23,241467331,Joe,Me and my family had a great stay in your fantastic place! <br/>Our kids and we loved your place and really felt at home. Its just a short walk to Richmond centre and the Thames.  We also found it very inspiring with all the art and literature though we didn't found enough time to read them all;-)  <br/><br/>Thanks  for your hospitality.

The large house has plenty of room for everyone, and was extremely comfortable with excellent amenities including a lovely garden. The walls are full of Dan’s incredible artwork, adding a special touch to this beautiful home. Dan was an excellent host, and made sure we had everything we needed. A really unique place!"
8494414,445436287,2019-04-29,3409475,Sophie,Dan was very easy and prompt with responses and the house was lovely. We really enjoyed relaxing there looking out over the garden and the location was great. I would highly recommend.

8494414,551569602,2019-10-20,87736777,Debbie,"The house is well situated and Richmond is lovely. It is worthwhile being aware of this house's layout. It is on 3 floors with 2 bedrooms and a bathroom on the second floor. The first floor has a TV room with a sofa bed and a bathroom with a shower over the bath; the TV room is not a bedroom as such. Also, this is a home which the owner still uses from time to time (albeit you get exclusive use of the property) rather than a dedicated holiday home. This impacts upon everything from presentation to available space; things to think about when deciding  whether the accommodation works for you.  The property was not right for our party for a variety of reasons but I can see from other reviews in 2019 that others have felt differently. I found Dan keen to address the points I raised with him; in that sense, he was a good host. I learned a lot about questions to ask in advance of a booking as I am a relatively new user of AIRBNB."
8494414,560309887,2019-11-06,57837751,Lara,"Dan's place was absolutely fabulous. My mom and 89 year old grandmother came to visit Richmond and we needed a space to house my entire family and Dan's place was perfect!! It felt just like being at home. Every wall is covered with his art and we had a fun time going around the house discussing each painting and imagining stories that may go along with it. Dan even let my grandmother play his piano! Such an efficient, organised and lovely experience. Thank you Dan!"

8494414,729175294,2021-02-06,5968857,Katerina,Amazing place in a great location and one of the best hosts I have come across. We stayed with my family at Dan's place for 1 month while relocating back to the UK with work. It was truly a home away from home and Dan has been extremely responsive and accommodating. The place itself is beautiful with the art of Dan all over the walls which is making the stay a truly unique and educational experience. I cant recommend the place enough - it has been the best airbnb experience i had both from a space and host pov.
8494414,742586062,2021-03-27,372932849,Jenni,"This is a gem. A beautiful old character home. The garden is magic, the location is perfect and the colourful art is wonderful to gaze at.

The warm and cosy apartment is a perfect shelter for three adults from the hectic environmen of London and it is just 10-15 minutes by foot from the nearest tube station (soutfield).
8522451,114035630,2016-11-15,26634469,Oscar,The flat is quite good. Not sure if 2 people can sleep in the sofa as I think is small. The flat is a bit far from the metro station but close (5min) from the bus stops and shopping center.

8522451,126610804,2017-01-13,67658237,Stephanie,This is a great apartment for exploring London.  It was very clean and comfortable for myself and two daughters. Tatiana was so helpful from the point of booking the place and regularly sent emails to help with checkin and even getting from the airport. The place is about 10 minutes to Southfield Tube station and 5 minutes from a big shopping centre. There are also buses nearby to take to the tube. Nice park of London and easy commute into central London. 
8522451,128270378,2017-01-23,83603350,Adam,"Very nice apartment, it was fairly close to public transport and shops, very clean and well maintained. It got quite cold in the nights because the heating was on a buildingwide timer. The host Tatiana was amazing with her communication and provided everything. 4* all in all "

8522451,140893660,2017-04-01,17461884,Paul,Stayed here during our house refurbishment works. Elegant and homely flat in the leafy village of Southfields. Pleasant walk to public transport and near to both Southfields and Wandsworth with plenty of places to eat with great shopping.
8522451,149684868,2017-05-05,122546997,Rachel,Tatiana is very nice and helpful.  Lovely quiet area. Simple flat.  Served purpose well 
8522451,151788729,2017-05-14,69280503,David,"Tatiana's flat was cleanly presented and is handily located equidistant between East Putney and Southfields tube station. There are a nice group of shops around the Southfields station and a large shopping centre only a few minutes walk across a lovely park. Tatiana was easily contactable when needed and provided an advice sheet on local shops, pubs, transport etc."
8522451,160044802,2017-06-12,119262119,Chris,"Incredible responsive and kind host, and a clean and well-maintained flat convenient to the area. Recommended!"
8522451,166037736,2017-07-02,88934837,Eduardo,Tatiana's flat is very close to the Wimbledon Tennis and easy to get public transport. The flat is clean and beautiful.<br/>She is a good host and always answered my messages.<br/>I recommend it
8522451,167528127,2017-07-07,81142631,Suzy,"Easy to find flat <br/>Nice to have a selection of ""essentials"" provided in the fridge<br/>Easy to contact host<br/>"
8522451,171337047,2017-07-17,128423373,Sameer,"First and foremost, a special mention to the host, Tatiana, she was amazing! I never had to wait for a reply and I felt like she was always eager to help. I wish I could have met her in person, but she made everything easy for us anyway. <br/><br/>The place is amazing, good enough for 3 people, and pretty close to Wimbledon. We were there specifically for Wimbledon and loved the fact that we could just walk over there.<br/><br/>It is a nice neighborhood as well, with pretty much everything available at walking distance (5-10mins walk) like grocery stores, bars, restaurants, tube stations, movie theatre. We walked back home late in the night around 11p-12a few times and it felt safe. <br/><br/>Couple of small things, although they might not affect everyone. First, if you have a car, you will have pay for parking during the week, but it’s free after 4:30p every day to 9:30a and weekends are completely free. Second, if you are visiting during Summer time, like we did, it might feel a bit warm in the apartment during the day, but it gets better in the night. We never felt the need for a fan or an AC after day1. <br/><br/>All in all, a memorable trip and would love stay here again if I get to come back for next year’s Wimbledon!<br/>"
8522451,184737625,2017-08-20,145929998,Natasha,Ideal place to stay and very peaceful and quiet
8522451,188476600,2017-08-29,74852665,Matthew,"Tatiana was a great host and got back to me very quickly, keys we're picked up from a key safe within a shop within 10 minutes walk from the flat which is second floor and looks onto other properties and roads. Flat is small modern and very clean. There's a Waitrose and other supermarkets in walking distance as well as a complex with a cinema and the usual array of restaurants and shops. I brought a car so didn't do the tubes but there's plenty of info on this site about which bus to catch and the tubes. Only downside is apart from weekend's you are charged for parking outside after 9.30am and you can only stay for 4 hours. You can park again for nothing after 4.30pm but this is London after all and free parking is at a premium, but i wish this had been noted in the post and when I asked directly about parking but this is a small niggle. Exit was fine apart from the walk to drop the keys into the shop again. Lovely flat in a lovely part of London."
8522451,190928615,2017-09-05,133817875,Gautam,This flat is cute and lively. Could not meet the host in person but she made sure our check-in/out goes smooth. She responded quickly to our requests as well. The place is peaceful and easily accessible by bus. Had a wonderful time. My five stars for sure :) Cheers!
8522451,200458686,2017-10-05,6113663,Deepa,Is a great place.  We were there for a few days in the process of relocating out of London so it was perfect for what we were looking for (weren’t going to see any touristy sights /access central London etc). Easy access to a bus stop which can then connect to tube stations and rail stations. Place has a well-equipped kitchen and Tatiana is super helpful- really responsive and always available when we had questions! The only thing to bear in mind if you have heavy/lot of luggage is that this is on the first floor with quite a narrow staircase (not surprising for London)- not a huge spoiler though but to take note. All in all we had a great stay and would come back again !
8522451,215353691,2017-11-29,145898377,Emma,"Excellent place, close to shops, park and great communication with the host.<br/>Highly recommend Tatiana's place :)"

8522451,365392726,2019-01-01,81318029,Khyati,Tatiana’s place was very spacious. The little touches that she gave to the apartment was very nice. The place is sufficient for two. The bedroom and kitchen was very spacious. The kitchen was well equipped. We found the bed smaller in size and was not the regular king size. So if you are people who sleep in king size bed then it might get uncomfortable. <br/>Tatiana was a super host. She was very quick in responding to all our queries. She arranged for us late check in and check out which was very nice of her. She also had put some welcome sweets taking care of our vegetarian requirement. The kitchen had stuff for breakfast so it was easy. It would have been great if she would had put in some breads and enough milk for our stay. <br/>The apartment is around 15 mins walk from the Southfields station and you can reach central London in 35-40 mins. Overall a great place to stay in. Thank you Tatiana for hosting us. <br/>Khyati and Gaurav
8522451,431611792,2019-04-01,14458292,Catherine,"Tatjana was very attentive to our comfort from the reservation, and throughout our stay. many tips on routes and local addresses, which we enjoyed a lot. I recommend highly."

She was clear in her checkin instructions and contacted me promptly before our checkin.

8522451,518881992,2019-08-27,209757697,Shannon,"Tatiana’s flat was gorgeous, tiny bit cosy! Had an alright check in had to go to a organic shop to pick up the keys from the locker. Got to the flat and as we arrived the lady who lives above Tatiana wasn’t very friendly but that didn’t stop us having a lovely stay. there was a big note on the table from Tatiana explaining how everything works and all the things you can do in the area and transport she also left us a little chocolate brownie treat which was kind of her. The only issue was the parking you have to pay from 9:30am - 4:30 on the machine. Overall I had a lovely stay"

It was spotless clean as the rest of the house, warm (Katherina never stops worrying how comfortable her guest are), and most importantly for us - friendly. We had been cared for in every way possible. As a host and accommodation she could be easily described as truly professionalista.<br/>Jury and Miglena"

8834649,58565975,2016-01-03,18318531,Jaclyn,"We had a wonderful stay at Katherina's! She is the loveliest host ever! She actually helped us a lot as my bf was having a really bad and painful abscess on his foot and she gave us a lot of useful advises and she even brewed herbs for him to soak his leg to help him ease the pain and reduce the inflammation. She also walked me to the chemist as well as the mini cab shop to call for a cab to the hospital. We really didn't expect that and we are so moved by her kindness. Apart from this, the room is exactly the same as showed in the picture and the flat itself is super cosy and it makes us feel so much like home! I will strongly recommend you to stay in here! <br/>P/S Katherina bakes awesomely tasty cake too yumz"

She offered to provide me with as much information as possible and kept the house very tidy. <br/><br/>The room was spectacular and by far one of the best rooms I've stayed in, especially with the décor. The entire house was well lit, clean, fresh and well-ventilated. The complimentary supply of tea, coffee, biscuits and a kettle within the room just topped it all off. This was all for a good price, particularly for London.<br/><br/>Thank you very much Katherina! "
8834649,74308757,2016-05-14,23080667,Darroch,"Kat was very welcoming, the room was exactly as described and very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this room to other visitors. Thank you :D"

8834649,111864973,2016-11-02,98777254,Лариса,I was greatly impressed by staying at Kat's home. The room was spacy and nice decorated. The bed was very comfortable.  All necessary pieces of furniture were there. Besides I could cook in the kitchen any time and use a fridge. Katherina is very friendly and hospitable. Also she gave me some information about London underground and trains. She's very helpful and sociable. I'm really happy to meet her. A few words about neighboring area. There are many cafes and shops not far from her house. It's 10 min. walk to get to the Underground and 2 min. - to the bus stop.  This area is quiet and nice)
8834649,123672238,2016-12-30,53536817,Adam,"Katherina's place is lovely. The location in Walthamstow is perfectly convenient to get a balance between access to central London, with peace, quiet and comfort and an affordable price. The room is a decent size with good facilities including a kettle, a fantastic array of tea to choose from, and some yummy chocolates and biscuits too. Although this accommodation is shared, one doesn't feeling they're intruding at all, due to the warm welcome but also the privacy offered by Katherina. We were able to use the kitchen and bathroom as we wished, and were provided with storage for food and toiletries. Katherina also has a lovely, friendly cat named Henrietta - we took quite a liking to her too! <br/>Not only did Katherina offer warm welcome and accommodation, she took time to make restaurant suggestions and share some experiences of theatre in London. <br/><br/>Our stay couldn't have been better. Highly highly recommend. "
8834649,125161861,2017-01-04,61271353,Lisa,"Die Zeit bei Katharina war super. Sie war sehr hilfsbereit und immer darum bemüht uns einen angenehmen Aufenthalt zu ermöglichen. Auch als wir durch eine Verspätung des Flugzeuges erst ziemlich spät abends ankamen, war das für Katharina kein Problem.  Die Unterkunft liegt zwar nicht ganz Central, aber die Verbindungen sowohl in die Stadt, als auch zum Flughafen waren sehr gut. <br/>Alles in allem hätten wir eine wirklich schöne Zeit in London. "
8834649,129531020,2017-01-31,99220672,Ayla,"Katherina's place is great - well connected to London, clean, quiet, with a lovely, friendly host and friendly cat. "

8834649,132734540,2017-02-19,10996549,Dimitrios,Katherina's place was exactly as described and shown in the pictures. 10 to 12min walk to whalthamstow central. Very good location close to Whalthamstow village as well.
8834649,137908541,2017-03-18,81926460,Elisa,"I spent 4 nights at Katherina's lovely home. The room is just as nicely decorated as it shows in the photos, clean, warm, with everything you need, as well as tea making facilities, towels, toiletries and hair-dyer in case you do not wish to bring your own. Katherina herself is a fantastic host, friendly, supportive, and knowledgeable of places in London you may want to visit. She will go beyond her duty for her guests and you can surely count on her for everything you may need. The bathroom is shared, very clean and beautifully decorated. The kitchen is also beautifully decorated, clean, and fully equipped with everything you need. The home is located in London's travel zone 3, less than 10 minutes walk from Walthamstow tube station. Trains to central London are very fast and you can be anywhere around the centre in a breeze. Walthamstow seems to me to be a safe area to be in, including after dark, and the street where the house is, is itself very quiet. There are also various restaurants on the main streets, and pubs and places where you can grab a bite. There is a sweet and friendly cat in the house, Henrietta, who will be a pleasant surprise to any cat lover. However Henrietta is very polite and quiet, so in case you do not fancy the idea of having a pet around the house, do not worry, she will not disturb you and will be barely noticeable. I will definitely stay again at Katherina's place when l am back in London, a true home away from home, and l would not hesitate to recommend this place for solo travellers as well as couples (the bed in the house is king size). An overall lovely experience for a first-time AirBnb user like myself. Thank you Katherina, see you soon! "
8834649,145190883,2017-04-17,123658522,Mauricio,"Excellent place. Even better that what is seen in pictures. Room is very big and also bed. Its very clean. bathroom is very clean.

I would have to come back to london, i would definitely come to katherina's place"
8834649,147222518,2017-04-25,81279126,Rebecca,"Felt very welcomed here- like I was in my own home. <br/>Close to tube, comfy bed, spacious room. Space for your things in kitchen etc. Happy; 1st time using air bnb."

I LOVED everything about the room I stayed in. I had a good night's sleep which is very important for me as a medical student. The bed was very comfortable to sleep on. Honestly, everything about the flat was perfect-- the location, the value, the ambience, etc. Katherina is a superb host. I HIGHLY recommend booking with her. I will definitely stay with her again in the future."
8834649,275550543,2018-06-11,56773196,Naa-Lamle,The bedroom is so lovely and unique. There is a lot of space in the room. You will feel at home and enjoy a good night's rest. Katherina does well to make sure that you are comfortable and satisfied. You will not be disappointed.

Comfy and well appointed accommodation."
8834649,331678976,2018-10-03,40112375,Emily,"Kat’s place is so lovely and Kat is so lovely ! The room was so thoughtfully and artfully put together. I felt very homey and comfortable the second I checked in. Kat is a caring and thoughtful host. I loved the location, there are coffee shops and restaurants right there and the tube is only about a 10 minute walk away with grocery stores and shops on the way if you need anything. I loved my stay here and will definitely stay again next time I’m in London."

8834649,352985281,2018-11-26,33719892,Carol,Kat's place is a welcoming safe haven with everything one needs. The house is compact but there is a lot more space in the room than many London rooms on that budget. You have a feeling of privacy and comfort despite the size. Kat has given a lot of thought to the interior decoration which is appreciated. Walthamstow wetlands are a must -visit within half hour walk or round the corner from Black horse tube. I  am so pleased Kat reminded me to go there! Walthamstow Village is also worth a visit.
8834649,354693718,2018-12-02,69715362,Endra,"Kats place is beautifully decorated :) even if the apartment is a little small, the room is spacious, clean and thoughtfully styled!

8834649,359870085,2018-12-18,40112375,Emily,"This was my second time staying with Kat. Her home and my room were so cozy and comfortable. The room is very atmospheric and winter themed. The bed is extremely comfy too. There’s more than enough room to stretch out in the room. The location of Walthamstow is very chill and only a few stops away from central London. It was nice to have a quieter part of London to return home to. Kat is very welcoming, funny and accommodating. I’ll def come again next time I’m in London! Thanks kat!"

She is a friendly face that everybody needs to see at a place, she is a good company and at the same time respects to privacy. <br/>The house is just 10mins walk from Walthamstove Central tube station which is on Victoria line ( Victoria Line is an advantage as it is working 24/7 ). Tesco express is only 2-3mins walk, the main street (hoe street) and the high street of Walthamstove Central is only 3-5mins away. <br/>The internet connection was always great and the house was always warm. The room and the house was very clean and the design of the house was unique!<br/>You should definitely choose Katherina’s place to stay if you are looking for a place like home :)"
8834649,421389603,2019-03-09,145024383,Lenka,"Kat was very friendly host who likes help with everything. I also love her cat Henrieta. :-) The room was big and cosy looking, my bed was very comfortable. I was very happy about having lots of hangers in the wardrobe. :-) I had the opportunity to use the collective kitchen and the bathroom. I missed a key from the bathroom.

She gives you a lot of privacy but is also a great host if you need to talk. The room is spacious and clean. There is lots of spots to store clothes and a table in case you need to use your computer. Her cat is so lovely and welcoming. My favorite part about my trip is meeting genuinely great people like her. Hopefully I can visit her soon again.

8834649,531385580,2019-09-17,12889944,Tony,"Private room in a small three bedroom apartment in deepest darkest Walthamstow. I don't usually subject myself to rooms and tend to go for whole places, but needs must! Kasia was very nice and we frequently spoke to each other. there is a cat and also a Romanian guy living in the other room. fine for a night or two if you're in the area. 10 min walk from the centre and close to Forest Road."

She was very quick to respond to messages, and was kind enough to let me check in early, as well as check out late. She also gave me lots of tips on where to eat and do some shopping, keeping in mind my dietary restrictions as a Muslim, which I found very thoughtful and helpful. <br/>Her home is very beautifully and creatively decorated, and I absolutely loved my room! It was very spacious, well-decorated, and the down pillows and duvet on the large bed were exactly what I needed after spending a month on a tiny bed in a cold attic at my last Airbnb. The cherry on top was her sweet little cat Henrietta, who was very well-behaved and got comfortable enough with me to spend afternoons next to me while I did my work.<br/>I honestly had such a good experience that I ended up extending my stay, and even booked again to stay with Katherina when I return from a short trip to Berlin to see a friend."

What I really liked that this place in comparison with other airbnb places was really worth to stay. Underground is nearby, Walthamstow market and pubs within walking distance, and I could use the kitchen!! Despite some airbnb places mentioned that kitchen amenities are available, you hardly can use it. Here you really could!! Thank you Katherina!"

8834649,493983535597744525,2021-11-12,129685530,Mattia,"Katherina's place is litterally amazing. It really feels like home in a sense that it brings you happiness to live in. The attention to details and the room's design is what impressed me the most, it's just wonderful.  The interior design is just magical, a bit like Alice in Wonderland or Frozen.<br/>The room is big, with a very comfy bed and matress, a useful table and an entire wardrobe, as well as a nice and big window wich allows to the natural light to come in. The bathroom is perfect, very clean and fragrant. The kitchen is clean and I got my spaces to store my food in the fridge and in the cupboard. <br/>Regarding the position, the apartment is located in Walthamstow, less than 10 min walk to the tube and overground station, in zone 3 at the end of the victoria line,  which brings you in central london in about 20 min. The district is very nice, familiar, with plenty of services, including a great sport center with gym and running track. <br/>Finally, Katherina is the best host I ever met, she is caring and approchable, and I'm really thankful and grateful to her for making my stay in London amazing. <br/>Summary: totally reccomended."
8911594,53827710,2015-11-13,46655951,Elizabeth,"What a great place! Phenomenal neighborhood and really nice flat. Accurate pictures and description. William and Rex were extremely responsive and helpful. Despite a minor issue with the hot water heater that was quickly rectified, we were very pleased and would recommend this flat to anyone."
8911594,54135400,2015-11-16,2019815,Niel,"Great stay at William's property. Apartment is cozy and well appointed, and in an ideal location. Communication with the host was prompt and informative. "
8911594,54613769,2015-11-22,47445618,Chris,"Wonderful apartment in a great location with many good restaurants close by. The apartment was like a 5 star hotel, very modern with nice touches like up-market bathroom accessories and lots of information to guide my visit. Will most def stay again!"
8911594,54878998,2015-11-25,28446936,Nina,"Staying at William's flat was my first experience as an Airbnb guest and I can say my friends and I we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. William and Rex (who manages the place) put a lot of effort into making us feel welcome and they were really helpful with their hosting. The flat was spotlessly clean and I (as an allergic person) especially appreciated the lovely wooden floor. The flat offered everything essential and the host even offered a folder with all useful information about the area and London in general. Really nice touch! The area couldn't be any better: just a short stroll to the tube and full with bars, restaurants and shops. Highly recommended! "
8911594,55120674,2015-11-28,9138789,Thierry,"The flat is clean and well situated.<br/>Is is quite alright if you need only one bedroom.  <br/>The second one is more a cupboard with an awful bed base. <br/>I hope William will invest in a new one. <br/>This would probably avoid misunderstanding with Rex who did not believe that I had to put the matress on the floor. Being treated a liar was not a very nice experience.<br/>Do not wait the last moment to call Rex, his basement is phone proof which can create communication problems. <br/>Otherwise we had a good time and the flat has many good sides."
8911594,55403476,2015-12-01,19836378,Huw,Great location and well appointed flat. Easy for tube and bus routes. Great communication from William and plenty of info available . Great place to stay if visiting London Town!
8911594,56034933,2015-12-08,8559322,Manuela,The appartement was really great. just perfect for a weekend in London. In the appartement there was everything you need and the surrounding was very lovely. <br/>It all was very clean and cozy.<br/>The appartement is close to the tube stations - so you can easily start your tourism programm. <br/>It all worked out perfect with picking-up the keys. <br/>I just can recommend William as a host with his great appartement.<br/>Thank you for the great stay ... hope we'll be back in London soon :-)<br/>
8911594,57134166,2015-12-22,4640741,Clark,"The place was better than expected: great location, very nice, very easy to  get in to.  I would stay here every time I go to London."

8911594,60257243,2016-01-21,47488700,Patricia,Lovely neighbourhood. Close to underground and buses on a fairly quiet residential street. William was very prompt in communication and helpful with directions etc. The flat was clean and comfortable with very nice linens. The kitchen had everything we needed. Loved the nice deep bathtub. It was perfect.<br/>
8911594,61640835,2016-02-07,48291126,Jason,"William's flat was very comfortable and is in a great location. It had all the amenities of home, lots of useful information on the immediate area and the city, and is under a10 minute walk to the underground station. This place would be 5 stars for a couple sharing the same bed. The second bed is very small so I used the pull out couch instead which was semi-comfortable."
8911594,64241432,2016-03-01,2475328,Ridhima,"Had a fantastic experience staying in Williams' flat! Location is unbelievable, flat is very well stocked and comfortable and William was really really great at being flexible, responsive - a truly great host. I highly recommend staying here and will most definitely stay here when I am next in London!"
8911594,65505596,2016-03-15,52347244,Kristin,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and I cannot say enough about how great it was!  William was wonderful and very responsive from the reservation stage through our arrival and departure.  He checked in often to make sure we had what we needed and even brought over additional blankets and pillows when I mentioned this Texas girl was struggling with the cold London temperatures!<br/>The flat was comfortable and clean and just perfect for what we needed while in town visiting our daughter who is studying in S. Kensington this semester.  It was a close and easy walk to the tube station, restaurants, and shopping so the location was excellent.<br/>I highly recommend this townhouse and in fact would stay again if I traveled back to London! "
8911594,68308939,2016-04-04,47572287,Dot,"What a lovely flat. Warm, comfortable, clean and greeted with a nice bottle of wine on arrival. We planned to do a lot of walking and that was easy to do staying here. The neighborhood was just wonderful with many things to do within a few minutes walk. The tube was easy to get to as well. I will recommend this flat to anyone who plans to visit London. We had an amazing time, feeling home away from home surely helped. Thanks William!"
8911594,70437724,2016-04-17,23587418,Nicholas,This is a great flat in an incredible area of town!  Everything is walkable!  I am looking forward to booking again.  (Website hidden by Airbnb) prepared to walk up 2 flights to the flat's door.<br/>
8911594,71671649,2016-04-27,7695319,Mark,"The townhouse in Chelsea was lovely: full of sunlight and close to the tube and museums, perfect for our family. William was an incredibly friendly and responsive host from the small bottle of welcome wine, a loaner soccer ball for my 10 year old, to the detailed instructions, to the very kind emails reminding us of the traffic caused by the London marathon. I couldn't recommend this AirBnB more highly. Thanks William!  "
8911594,73072942,2016-05-06,14118689,Corentin,"Good contact with William, everything was perfectly indicated, he is very used to receiving guests!"
8911594,77439142,2016-05-31,27579285,Donna,All was waiting for us in place.  Neighborhood information was very complete and thorough.  William's communication before and during our delightful stay was prompt and caring.<br/>Fantastic experience in updated yet cozy flat.  I am a real estate agent in the States so I see alot of homes all the time and have a more critical eye than most so my review of the flat and William are very high.  My husband was very happy as well.
8911594,80994882,2016-06-20,20559407,Margaret,"tl;dr - This is a fantastic flat, and if you're looking for something convenient to transit and in a lovely neighborhood for 3-5 people (especially families), this is a great place.<br/><br/>1) William is amazing.  So much contact before/during/after the experience.  If you have a question, he has an answer.  Getting the key was simple, tidying up before we left was equally easy.  There's a whole book full of information and tips for people staying in the flat, and I even asked some of those and he never made me feel like a dummy.<br/><br/>2) All the amenities you need.  Wifi (YES), washer, dishwasher, nice-sized beds, privacy in the evenings.  There were even left a few little bottles of wine that made the experience that much better.<br/><br/>3) The neighborhood is freaking adorable.  So many lovely little shops and restaurants.  There is a hotel next door, and the people at the restaurant/bar can be a little noisy at night, but it's a city, and you deal with it.  Unless you're farther out, it's not going to get a whole lot quieter.<br/><br/>4) ACCESS TO TRANSIT - the Gloucester Road tube station is a short walk away - 10/15 minutes, and the Picadilly + Circle/District lines go nearly everywhere a visitor to the city could want to visit.  There's also the Earl's Court and South Kensington Road stops within easy distance.  If you need Overground, West Brompton is a little further, but still very walkable.  Buses everywhere.  <br/><br/>5) We were two adults and two children, and the setup was great.  Adults had the master bedroom, and the kids switched off in the bedroom and on the sofa bed, but conveniently there are doors to every room, so even the sofa bed/living room had privacy at night if needed.  Our kids even fought over the sofa bed because it was bigger than the twin in the bedroom!  As a note, you could probably fit two kids on the sofa bed, but two adults might be tight."
8911594,83593672,2016-07-03,62032219,A,"The flat was exactly what we wanted.  The space was pleasant and had all the amenities we needed.  We particularly liked the location.  The street was lovely, and it was an 8 minute walk to the tube, and just a bit longer to lovely museums.  We had a great few days."
8911594,86289678,2016-07-15,25882618,Astrid,William goes beyond what is required to make your stay pleasant as well before as during our stay. His communication is perfect. The perfect host. Location is privileged in London for this larger than average flat in London terms. Beds are very new and are comfortable. We would come back
8911594,87944785,2016-07-22,60758311,Jonathan,Nice place!  Easy walk to/from Glouster Road station. Very nice neighborhood in all directions. <br/><br/>Apartment was clean and comfortable. 
8911594,90679150,2016-08-01,40677730,Cindy,"This apartment in Chelsea has the perfect size for a family of 3 to 4 people. It's located in a super convenient and safe location. Lots of supermarkets, restaurants, cafe and bakeries around. 5 minute walk to South Kensington tube station. Also easy walk to National History Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum. For joggers like me, there is a great running course toward the Thames, across the bridge then there is a big park. For the apartment itself, it's clean, spacious, quiet and well equipped. William is a good host that never bothered answering any of my questions although many of the answers I could easily find in the welcome book. I will definitely return to this place. Thank you William.<br/>天朝的朋友们，这是伦敦的最佳住所，安全､方便､干净，房主回复及时，性价比很高。<br/>家族三人と6泊止まらせてもらい､最高な経験だと思います。安全､便利､駅まで歩いて5分間､博物館も近いです。ｵｰﾅｰのWilliamさんが質問の多い私に何もかも速やかに答えにくださって助かりました。"
8911594,91746988,2016-08-06,69840964,Sandrine,Séjour très agréable très content de la prestation sa rendait à nos attentes merci pour tout
8911594,94282909,2016-08-15,81485553,Octavio,"Estupenda ubicación acorde con la zona en que se encuertra, Chelsea,  apenas cuatro paradas del bullicio del centro de Londres pero disfrutando de la tranquilidad y serenidad de un barrio residencial.  El apartamento es más que suficiente para una cómoda estancia de varios días, aún con niños, y su anfitrión no duda en cuidar que te sientas como su invitado no su inquilino con información más que suficiente para cualquier necesidad que pueda surgir. Quizá la escalera de acceso lo limita para personas con movilidad reducida, pero hablamos de un edificio con más de un siglo aún en perfecto estado. En resumen, genial."
8911594,96633214,2016-08-23,46002927,Josh,"What a great first AirBnB experience - perfect location, beautiful apartment; so glad we chose this over a local hotel.<br/><br/>Everything worked great, they had even thought of a lot of little details like leaving a selection of phone charging cables. Arrival was easy, instructions were very clear. <br/><br/>Thank you for a great stay in London!"
8911594,98790299,2016-09-01,11666197,Adam,"Incredible location in a quiet pocket of Chelsea/South Kensington.  Great quick, responsive communication from William at every step.  Looking forward to coming back soon!"
8911594,99387818,2016-09-04,37091358,Jen,"William's place is great-- fabulous location.  As others mentioned, he was responsive and very helpful prior to and during our stay.  Four of us stayed quite comfortably and we loved returning to the flat after being out and about all day and night.  Hope to return to London and Roland Gardens!"
8911594,100648613,2016-09-10,57922244,Susan,Great experience.  We were able to check in early.  Loved the little balcony where I would often sit at end of evening for a bit !  What was a wonderful surprise was the phone charger/adapter that was available to us .... Great touch!  
8911594,103930422,2016-09-25,55918560,Augie,"William was very quick to respond and especially accommodating.  We were staying in London for 10 days and had been struggling to find a decent place to stay, but William quickly put all of our fears to rest.  <br/><br/>The space is perfect for 3 people, 4 could work but would be rather tight.  There is a full kitchen and a large bathtub that I was happy to take advantage of after a long day of touring.  The neighborhood is safe and there is a tube station only a few minutes walk from the flat.  The tube provides easy access to all of London. <br/><br/>Overall 10/10 would recommend and would stay again."
8911594,104942834,2016-09-29,3720786,Lachlan,William's apartment is wonderful. Very comfortable and clean. It's in a lovely location which is quiet and close to public transport. It's a charming London apartment.<br/>William is a star as a host. He was very helpful and flexible. Thanks William!

He was extremely quick with responding to all messages and answering any questions. <br/><br/>The check-in/out experience was also very smooth and clearly laid out. The flat in itself was also nice, with all the facilities and amenities one could ask for. Its location in South Kensington/Chelsea was perfect for us, nice and quiet while still being very central.<br/><br/>I would recommend William and his apartment to anyone visiting London. A truly great experience!"
8911594,107042523,2016-10-09,9522313,Anne-Marie,"We've had countless Airbnb experiences, but this was undoubtedly the best.

We cannot recommend it more highly!"
8911594,108207746,2016-10-15,17021956,Randi,William was a warm and welcoming host!

Chelsea is an amazing suburb, with everything you would ever need in walking distance from the apartment. William was great, very attentive and assisted with local recommendations for coffee shops through to restaurants..<br/><br/>Thanks for a great stay William, we'll definitely stay again in the future..."
8911594,110142367,2016-10-24,78983537,Harald,If two or three of want to stay in the heart of Chelsea then look no further. The flat is fab. With all the bells and whistles one could wish for. Nice balcony with a great view over the rooftops too. Perfect!

This was one of our best experiences with airbnb and we would stay here again in an instant."
8911594,143056614,2017-04-10,18612439,Eric,"This is a great flat in a perfect location. This was our first Airbnb experience, and we weren't disappointed. The flat was exactly what we needed for our family vacation in London - the neighborhood is quiet and only a short walk away from great shops, restaurants, and the Gloucester Underground station. William was wonderful host. He provided detailed instructions and area information (he even responded quickly when we accidentally locked ourselves out). If you are planning a visit to London, I can't recommend William's flat highly enough."
8911594,145164382,2017-04-17,118252060,Emily,"The flat is really nice—very comfortable and very quiet, with nice light, comfortable furniture and beds and a very generous amount of space. We found the neighborhood convenient to stay in. You can walk to the Natural History Museum, V&A museum, Science Museum, Serpentine Gallery and Hyde Park, so it’s a great location for families. The two close-by tube stations are only a short walk away, and it’s an easy ride on the Piccadilly line from Heathrow. There are plenty of supermarkets, including a large Waitrose in the Gloucester Road station. There are also plenty of restaurants a few streets away. William responds right away if there are any problems or questions, and he was very accommodating about check-in and check-out times, so we weren’t juggling our luggage while sight-seeing. I would happily stay here again."
8911594,146228163,2017-04-22,2532557,Kristina,Location is superb.  You can walk to some of london's attractions.  You can also bike to some and the underground was just a few minutes walk.  <br/>There were also several supermarkets which are also just a few minutes walk. <br/>Guil was also flexible as a host.  
8911594,148693882,2017-05-01,59022580,Cathi,The living space was clean and spacious and in a great location.  Communication with William was quick and clear.  All of the appliances worked and the beds were comfortable.
8911594,150653855,2017-05-08,65355650,Adria,The host canceled this reservation 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8911594,151284931,2017-05-12,13974539,Linda,William is a lovely host - kind & helpful & was especially flexible regarding our early arrival in London &  needing to check in. The apartment is very comfortable & in a superb location - no hesitation recommending this apartment & host!!!
8911594,156792083,2017-06-01,3298883,Megan,We just had a fantastic stay in William's flat. The space was perfect for our family of four. The location was excellent and a five minute walk to the tube. We had enough space to spread out. One of our daughters slept in the twin bedroom and the other on the pullout sofa. The street is quiet. It was a good value. We will be recommending William's flat to friends and would definitely stay again in the future.  
8911594,161447552,2017-06-18,29372478,Pavel,"Very nice flat for a family. Nice location. Good equipped. Two tube stations are 10 min walking. Plenty of cafes and shops nearby. Very clear directions and excellent communication. Few minor things need to be taken into account: 1) Blakes hotel/restaurant is right next door, so expect some little noise over week-end nights, but it is London and it is noting close to a pub noise. 2) no elevator 3) wall paint should be freshened one day, but it doesn't downgrade the place. Will stay again one day. Thank you, William!"
8911594,164054040,2017-06-26,93933354,Paul,"This is a great place to stay if you want to stay near downtown London. You are only a short walk to the tube, and it gets you into the heart of London, Big Ben/London eye in 5 short stops. William was incredible, responded to every question we had within minutes. The place was comfortable, two bedrooms and a bath. "
8911594,167001255,2017-07-05,80207869,Andrew,Great place in a wonderful location. William is an amazing host who goes the extra mile and then some. Our kids managed to lock themselves out of the apartment and they were unable to reach us....potentially a bad situation was quickly solved by William and other tenants in the building. Such a safe and friendly community. A great air bnb experience. No hesitation to recommend. 
8911594,172630813,2017-07-21,114597359,Rodney,Great spot. William very helpful. Recommend.
8911594,172845887,2017-07-22,65593200,Alex,"Very nice London flat in an upscale neighborhood of older row houses.  Flat itself is well equipped and a good layout for our family of three - may be a bit tight for much more than that, though there was a small sofa bed that we didn't make use of.  Great central location, but still relatively quiet. Abut 15  minute walk to two Tube stops (Cromwell and South Kensington) to get to all of the London areas, and shorter than that to local commercial streets with bus lines. Great museums (Victoria and Albert, Natural History, Science) in the Kensington neighborhood just to the north.  Grocery stores and banks an easy walk away.  Several good restaurants and pubs (we liked the Anglesea Arms and the Duke of Clarence) not far.  One minor drawback is the relatively quiet hotel next door that has a restaurant - you can hear some of the louder patrons and cars leaving late at night from both bedrooms, which face the street.  But for Central London, this has to be as quiet as it gets.  The host William is very accommodating and responsive."
8911594,178892172,2017-08-06,25369798,Erin,"We had a wonderful time staying at William's flat. We have 2 children, and we had plenty of room. The tube is minutes away, and there are many shops and restaurants near by. We had a lovely stay."
8911594,186937124,2017-08-26,6353937,Sherene,"This is an amazing apartment - clean, accessible, new, comfortable, quiet, good wifi with a great location. The apartment was on one of the most beautiful residential streets in South Kensington and yet very close to all the amenities eg tube, butcher, supermarket, cafes. Best of all, William was a great host and very responsive. Highly recommended."
8911594,269791263,2018-05-28,28121554,James,"I can't say enough about William as a host. My father and I dealt with some unexpected twists and turns on our trip, and William was extremely helpful in ensuring that our trip was not derailed. The apartment itself is nice, and the neighborhood is stunning. Thanks again, William!"
8911594,274540172,2018-06-09,95990637,Mike,"William is an outstanding host and our experience in London was amazing. William quickly answered all our questions, even those submitted prior to booking. Check-in was quite easy and we were able to access the flat early. With the neighborhood information provided, we quickly grew comfortable and felt at home. The flat is very nice. Clean and well-equipped and a good size for our family of three. It's on the third floor so you will need to get used to climbing the stairs. The small terrace is nice for morning coffee. The location provided easy access to the Underground with the Gloucester or South Kensington stops within a ten to fifteen-minute walk. Once onboard, many major attractions are within just a few stops. If you prefer to stay local, there are many restaurants and pubs nearby. Feeling adventurous? Put on your hiking shoes and stride up to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace or maybe over to Stamford Bridge for a tour of Chelsea Football Club’s facilities. As you can see, we thoroughly enjoyed staying here. I definitely recommend William as a host and this property as one to pick for a positive stay in London."
8911594,283210830,2018-06-29,53117003,Kirsten,"This little flat was ideal for our family of four. The location is fantastically central for all the sights of London. We were able to quickly jump on the tube and head off to all corners of the city. The flat was a good size, and despite the unusually warm weather (30+), cooled nicely in the evenings. We would absolutely stay here again."
8911594,286410809,2018-07-06,39084673,Bobby,This is a great central London flat with a perfect host.  I stayed here with my family of four and everyone enjoyed themselves.  William was great with recommendations and was quite accommodating on our last day.  I highly recommend you stay here.
8911594,290968687,2018-07-15,34537008,Kristina,"We very much enjoyed our stay at William’s apartment. It was perfectly suited for our family of three. Everything was as described and William was very responsive to all our questions. The location is great for restaurants, museums, shopping and traveling to other districts of London. We would definitely stay here again when coming to London. Thank you William."
8911594,293038820,2018-07-19,89193057,Justin,Great place.  Was there with my family - 4 of us altogether with 2 kids under 5 years old. Right amount of space and location was fantastic for our holiday
8911594,301527222,2018-08-04,194064162,Caroline,"William's place is in a lovely street, close to a tube station and buses. Well maintainted, and very clean. Lots of linen and towels left for us. We walked to several places easily,  supermarkets located at Gloucester St station tube. The apartment coped well with the unusually warm temps. No problems at all with our stay. We had a great time!"
8911594,315555330,2018-08-29,188452879,Farah,"My family loved this place! We traveled with our 1.5 year old and 4 year old, and the extra bedroom definitely came in handy and was set up with a portable crib. It’s a great location, 12 min walk to the museum strip, close to the Gloucester road and south Kensington tube stations (8-10 min walk and a very pleasant walk). Nice residential area but close to many restaurants and supermarkets and five min from most bus stops. We loved the little balcony too and how the living area is a little separate from the bedrooms . This apartment  embodied the  reason we went with an air bnb as opposed to a cramped hotel room! Good working kitchen, nice shower, comfy beds. We were very happy here!"
8911594,331380600,2018-10-02,47445618,Chris,"Like being at home in a great location with everything you need close by (food, transport...)."
8911594,336493348,2018-10-14,107582085,Vegard,"Perfect location for a stay in London. Clean flat, quick and easy communication with William, well equipped flat. Enough space for a family of five. We can warmly recommend this appartement and will likely come back."
8911594,347987085,2018-11-12,83566752,Phil,"We enjoyed our stay at William’s place. The location was a close walk to many shops, restaurants, pubs, and the Tube. It was easy to get around London and see many things from this location.  Would stay here again. <br/><br/>William was quick to respond with any questions or concerns we had."
8911594,352409595,2018-11-25,87550280,Heidi,"We loved staying at William’s place, it was perfect for our family of three! It was in an excellent location, walkable to restaurants, museums and the underground. The neighborhood itself is beautiful. Williams place was clean, comfortable and felt like home. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
8911594,354323120,2018-12-01,25327122,John,"Excellent location on a beautiful block. Quick access to both King’s Road and Fulham Road. Many restaurants in the area, and close to museums. Flat is great once you get up the stairs. Nice small balcony offers a neighborhood housing view and chance for fresh air. Served our needs perfectly."
8911594,366306454,2019-01-02,120840460,Carlos,Having stayed at a few airbnb apartments around Europe I can see why William is a super host . He went above and beyond to help out on our trip to London. The apartment is everything that you would expect from the ad and in a truly convenient location to wonderful places in London.
8911594,407493493,2019-02-02,213294,Joanna,"Great central location and perfect for our small family - near the museums and lots of good food, and a short walk to tubes and buses. The flat was very clean and well equipped  - it had everything we needed. Also very small-child friendly!"
8911594,426227200,2019-03-20,126204039,Grant,Great location and excellent support from William. Flat was clean and ideal for a couple plus one. Felt very safe walking around area and some great walks from flat to museums and parks.  Highly recommend.
8911594,456776964,2019-05-22,3598444,Al,"My wife, adult daughter and I stayed at William's flat during our recent visit to London and had a great time.  Prior to the trip, we were a little concerned that it might be a bit far from a tube station, but that turned out not to be the case, as there are 2 stations within easy walking distance.   The flat is in a residential neighborhood, and so was very quiet most of the time.  The first evening we spent exploring Chelsea, which also within easy walking distance.  The flat is as advertised, and communication was excellent.  We would definitely consider staying there again."
8911594,480742842,2019-07-03,238362551,Jennifer,"Great flat for our family of four.  Nice quiet safe neighborhood.  Underground stop less than 10 min walk, plenty of places to eat around the flat.  William was super accommodating to our early arrival time and very helpful when we were looking to find a local pub to watch the women’s World Cup game.  Highly recommend!"
8911594,490308847,2019-07-18,45505776,Luis,"I'd say the essential part of staying at Williams flat in Chelsea is that one becomes part of London. The flat itself is near two tube stations, museums, dry cleaners, and many restaurants and pubs. But you also get the serenity and silence that comes with a well-situated home. The flat itself is clean and comes with all the comforts one needs for a short or long stay. We stayed for two weeks with our seventeen-year-old son, and all went great. We contacted William a couple of times and he was always accessible with useful information. Great place to stay and will come back for sure."
8911594,497349323,2019-07-28,19630620,Jennie,"Lovely flat with plenty of room for our family of four, great walkable location with easy access to both busses and Underground, we loved having the balcony on hot days!"
8911594,533345165,2019-09-21,52272361,Eva,"William is thoughtful and thorough with his communication, which ensures a comfortable stay. The location is great and the flat is cozy, and well laid out."
8932746,52895455,2015-11-02,28442280,Arthur,Really nice holidays in this great flat. Good localisation to visit the heart of London. There is a beautiful view from the flat and this one is also really clean.<br/>So a good experiance in a pretty flat. 
8932746,53767320,2015-11-12,47094893,Irene,"Delizioso appartamento, luminoso, spazioso, pulito, fornito di tutto (lavastoviglie, lavatrice, asciugacapelli, asse da stiro ecc.).<br/>Posizione centralissima, comoda per visitare la città.<br/>Ci hanno accolti con puntualità e gentilezza e se torneremo a Londra ci rivolgeremo sicuramente a questo host."
8932746,55400978,2015-12-01,3694468,Pascale,L'appartement est très bien situé et convient tout à fait pour une famille .Il est propre et agréable .
8932746,57131630,2015-12-22,39666994,Claire,"Loved the apartment and efficiency of Paula's team. Everything you need is neatly stacked away. Plenty of room. Excellent location, easy walking distance to so much! Vibey area teeming with coffee, food, pubs, theatres. Double glazing almost eliminates the pub and Tesco restock noise. And well priced. Teeny niggle: wifi signal really weak. Highly recommend this for central London stay."
8932746,61299480,2016-02-02,52550894,Ann,We had a great stay in London. The central location of this flat is fantastic. The flat is really well equipped. We would recommend it to friends.
8932746,61775442,2016-02-08,27907767,James,"<br/>Flat as described, great location in Covent Garden area. Didn't meet Paula unfortunately .but we did correspond via mobile and emails. We arrived a little later due to rail delays but representative met with us and showed us around flat."
8932746,63067863,2016-02-20,28182477,Truda,"The location, lay out and amenities of this apartment are fabulous.<br/>It is right above a pub and beside a Tesco but noise levels are acceptable after midnight since there is a double window pane.<br/>All is in great shape, the light shines in through the large windows, sun pours in on bright mornings. Right in the centre of Covent Garden all transit connections are near and shops, theatres and restaurants at walking distance. <br/>However there was a pungent odour in the master bath and bedroom.<br/>The host has promised to address this and has granted us a rebate after we left.<br/>Communication and information were excellent, Paula provided us with both before, during and after our stay. "
8932746,64511692,2016-03-05,54776213,Bénédicte,"Ce séjour fut notre première expérience par Air b&b.<br/>Malheureusement, nous n’avons pas rencontré Paola puisque c’est une agence qui gère la location.<br/>L’appartement est bien placé, très proche de la station Leiceister Square et Coven Garden. De nombreuses lignes de bus passent aussi très près.<br/>Le bruit de ce quartier animé reste très correct et ne s’arrête pas trop tard.<br/>L’appartement est au 2ème étage, assez difficile d’accès par un escalier peu large et pentu. Heureusement, le charmant jeune homme qui nous a accueilli s’est empressé de nous aider à monter nos valises.<br/>L'appartement correspond bien aux photos mais nécessiterait malgré tout un rafraichissement.<br/>Le gros problème est que nous n’avons pu utiliser la salle de bains qui jouxte l’une des chambres : l’odeur de moisi était très importante et désagréable.<br/>Il nous a fallu refermer la porte très rapidement et ne plus l’ouvrir pour que l’air de la chambre redevienne respirable ! C'est le seul point négatif, dommage...<br/> "
8932746,65222926,2016-03-12,53844903,Colin,Great location! At the heart of the city and close to everything! The flat was clean and roomy. It would have been a 10/10 if it wasn't for the smell in the master bathroom thus I give the flat a 9/10. Definitely a great value.
8932746,65960440,2016-03-18,57740189,Yoichi,Great flat in the heart of London. perfect to go anywhere with great (Website hidden by Airbnb) tube stations to bus stops to embankment pier. <br/><br/>Tesco metro is opposite the flat and this was a huge bonus as its a service apartment. 
8932746,67380642,2016-03-29,21434223,Charlotte,"Very good location, very nice and bright apartment. Everything was fresh and clean. They even cleaned the apartment and changed bedlinen after 5 days, we stayed 10 days. Everything worked smoothly. We had some problem with bad smell in one of the bathrooms, but they fixed that after two visits by a plumber.<br/>The good part that its not someones apartment with a lot of private things..."
8932746,68707312,2016-04-06,31081002,Esther,Todo perfecto el único pero es que es algo ruidoso
8932746,69099046,2016-04-09,10807310,Claudine,"Appartement spacieux, très confortable, très bien équipé et idéalement situé...juste un peu bruyant."
8932746,69687529,2016-04-12,56274201,Lynette,The apartment was well located and had everything needed for a comfortable stay. Location is excellent to all tourist attractions. Nicely located close to shops in Covent Garden. Tesco is across the road for convenient food supplies. It can be a bit noisy with Tesco loading at night and the pub downstairs is noisy on weekends nights more than during the week but the convenient location and spacious apartment made up for the noise. 
8932746,71334473,2016-04-24,46207276,Fortunato,"It is a perfect location for people who likes to shop and loves to eat and drink. There is a grocery across the street, a pub downstairs, and lots of restaurants nearby. The tube stop is nearby. "
8932746,71822708,2016-04-29,13490469,Jennifer,"Lovely apartment with a great location! A tube stop is very close by. Lots of light and space.  Paula was very communicative and helped us check in earlier than expected. Wifi is a bit spotty at times, but otherwise an amazing stay!"
8932746,72746975,2016-05-04,38779961,Jeff,"We are from Ohio, US. My in-laws, pregnant wife, and I loved the location and space of the flat. It was close to multiple tube spots, which made sightseeing a breeze with the Oyster card. On the weekends, from the Round House bar below, there was white noise, with the occasional outburst of a screaming soccer fan. The host, Paula, was very personable, and answered all of my questions via email in a timely manner. "
8932746,73218343,2016-05-07,32507936,Nadine,"Everything was great, beside the wifi was not working."
8932746,74883276,2016-05-17,32705181,Marta,"Todo perfecto. Paula estuvo disponible para contactar con ella en todo momento. El apartamento grande, luminoso, limpio y fantásticamente situado. Muy recomendable."
8932746,75714945,2016-05-22,12749352,Marie,Very well located and nice appartment but really noisy place. Especially at night as there's a pub just under.<br/>
8932746,76256845,2016-05-26,1351295,Maria,"This apartment is fantastic, really in the centre of Covent Garden and so handy for shops and restaurants, I expected it to be noisy overnight but it wasn't at all, the apartment is spacious and comfortable, well equipped and plenty of towels and soft furnishings. I would definitely stay again as it is perfect for theatre visits and shopping. Just a few minutes walk from the tube, so from arrival at Euston to the apartment took just 20 mins. "
8932746,80036259,2016-06-15,59584005,Joao,"Excellent localization, very central and near several services including a supermarket and the underground (convent garden or Leicester). Very good areas, big enough for 6 people and the only thing that could be better is the isolation of the noise in the living room (it's a nightlife place and who sleeps in the living room ears some noise). It's the price to pay to be in the middle of where everything happens..."
8932746,81576209,2016-06-23,30074392,Dino,Great location close to everything you will need and want to see. We were met by one of Paula's friends who gave us some great welcome tips. Hope to be back one day.
8932746,82811370,2016-06-29,28838880,Alison,"For the money we paid I expect more.<br/><br/>Firstly the good points - the flat is in a busy, loud, bustling, vibrant area above a pub in Covent Garden - this is one of the reasons we choose to stay in this area, and we have stayed in many AirBnBs in the area in the last year.  It's central and easy to access.  The flat is quite nicely furnished, with recently renovated bathrooms and kitchen, and the sheets and towels are clean.<br/><br/>But this particular flat was the worst one we've stayed in.  The entrance is dingy and old, the flat itself is quite worn and a bit shabby.  The floorboards in the kitchen are so squeaky you wake up the entire house if you walk over them at night. All of this we could have overlooked as 'quaint'.  But the roof in both the bathrooms started leaking on our second night (of a four night stay).  So we reported it to the contact person who reacted with disinterest.  With all the water around, we couldn't turn the lights on without blowing the fuses.  Sometime the next day someone must have come in to see to the problem - the solution appeared to be a bucket.  The water dripped in the main bathroom for the next two days, until the end of our stay, with no communication from the owner.  Also the wifi was unreliable and spent a lot of time not working, but would then flick on and work for a short time.  We hadn't had a problem with this in previous flats in the area.<br/><br/>I wouldn't mind this so much in a cheap apartment - part of what you expect.  But not for the amount of money we were paying here.  There are far better options than this flat in Covent Garden.  "
8932746,83144488,2016-07-01,60784706,Janel,The host canceled this reservation 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8932746,83947121,2016-07-04,21314643,Linda,"We loved this apartment and it's location. We would absolutely stay there again if we came back to London and recommend to our friends. <br/>It's a 15 minute walk to the London Eye, 20 minutes from Big Ben, 8 minutes from Trafalgar Square and a short cab or uber to the Tower of London. The neighborhood itself is great. There is a market right across the street which was really convenient. <br/>We read many of the reviews and here's the truth about the noise. It is not quiet as its right above a bar, The Round Bar which we really enjoyed, but with ear plugs we slept fine. It also closes at midnight but it is a popular area so you will hear noise. Our 15 and 12 year old girls slept with a noise machine noise going on their iPhone and again with ear plugs never had an issue sleeping. <br/>We did have a water leaking issue in the bathrooms due to a building issue that wasn't resolved when we were there but Paula handled the issue well. Again, would highly recommend this place. "
8932746,89792850,2016-07-30,43329800,Rafael,"Location, location, location.  Wonderful flat in the middle of the ac"
8932746,91088440,2016-08-03,11004801,Paul,"The flat is very nice, huge rooms and in a great location. Could not want for a better area to stay in. Despite being about a pub and on the corner of a busy streets in Covent Garden it was very quiet/. The windows are double glazed. <br/><br/>The wifi was very poor quality which is frustrating. Otherwise our stay was great."
8932746,101819784,2016-09-15,22007893,Stuart,Very centrally located in heart of Covent Garden. That comes with all the noise and energy of this central area but why else would you stay there? Two spacious bedrooms and well appointed bathrooms. Everything very clean. The living area could do with some additional comfortable seating for guests who are spending more time in the flat (not us). Very efficient key collection process (they chased me to make sure all was organised re checkin etc). It's a two storey walk up on a narrow staircase if that's an issue for anyone.
8932746,109201173,2016-10-20,21304859,Liran,As other people mentioned the place   is located right between Leicester square and the Covent garden market. 2 min walk from each. Perfect base when you tour the center of London. The flat is convenient for 4 people. We were two adults with two teenagers. The kitchen and leavingroom space is very nice and comfortable for home cooking. You can buy groceries at the Tesco store downstairs. <br/>Things to be aware of: there is noise from the street that might awake a light sleeper early in the morning. <br/>There stairway to the flat is narrow and steep. Need to make sure you can bring your luggage upstairs or get assistance. 
8932746,110613581,2016-10-27,70440027,David,So utterly spot on! A fabulous flat and perfect for a stay in London. Thanks ever so much for the stay. 
8932746,112512201,2016-11-06,99464294,Christian,"We enjoyed our stay. Check-in was easy, a friend of Paula handed us<br/>the keys in the flat and showed us around.<br/>The flat is in good shape, clean and very central next to Covent Garden.<br/>Instead of the wooden floor in bedrooms, that was on the photos we had carpet in the<br/>bedrooms, but was ok for us. Internet was fast and reliable. Living in this<br/>area means noise at night, and in the morning the Supermarket opposite<br/>unloads the trucks.. For those who are comfortable with this area - very nice!"
8932746,115173501,2016-11-22,84099463,Amy,"This is an immaculate apartment, lovely bedding, nice common space- really perfect. Great value. <br/><br/>Location great. Two pubs visible from the unit. Loved the Lamb and the Flag. Convient for theater, great restaurants, close to public transport. It is a multi use neighborhood offices, markets, restaurants. We liked that. But there is noise with early morning delivers to food establishments. <br/><br/>We would stay again. "
8932746,121477855,2016-12-17,93477417,Maurizio,"Location ottima, flat comodo ai servizi / trasporti  e centrale su londra; dotazioni cucina insufficiente: mancano canovacci da cucina,, tutto il materiale per pulire la cucina,  manca un aspirapolvere  (basilare avendo moquette e parquet) , una solo scopa ""da barby"", manca una straccio da terra e spezzattone, infissi bagni con spifferi soprattutto bagno piccolo......appt piuttosto rumoroso fino a notte tarda, persiane con fessure entra luce nelle camera, camere fredde,termosifoni poco accesi"
8932746,122384549,2016-12-23,63773348,Terri,"We loved our stay here. We had a couple of minor complaints (no dryer as listed in amenities, and while the bathrooms were pretty clean, there were a couple of dark spots in the shower caulking), but the flat is in a GREAT area of Covent Garden - which is such a charming part of London. We were close to Theatre, dining, a Tesco store and easy transportation. As others have stated, there is quite a bit of noise at night, and the stairs are narrow and steep - not a problem for us, but something to be aware of. The beds are very comfortable, and it was a good place to call home while we stayed in London. There were 6 of us staying there - 4 adults and 2 kids, and it was sufficient space. The couch was already made up as a bed when we arrived, which was nice. We would stay here again if given the opportunity. "
8932746,123857980,2016-12-31,2915163,Terence,"The flat is fantastically located for access to Covent Garden & Leicester Square, and by extension Piccadilly Circus and the Oxford Street shopping belt. The area is very very lively and can be noisy for some, but is exactly what one should expect staying right at the edge of the West End. Very convenient for food, sightseeing, theatre and shopping. The flat is clean and professionally maintained. A great cost-effective option for a large group!"
8932746,129050284,2017-01-29,110408210,Hanna,The flat was very nice! The place got everything you need and it was clean. you do not need to walk far to find places to eat. Paula was very friendly and the check in and check out was pleasant.
8932746,130306425,2017-02-05,106574037,Vicki,Great place to stay if you want to be right in the heart of Covent Garden and Theatreland. Lots of restaurants and bars around which are noisy at night. Great nachos at The Roundhouse below and they very kindly accommodated us and all our bags while we waited to check in. 
8932746,137552601,2017-03-16,108844176,William,Excellent flat right in the middle of the action. It worked very well for our family of 4. 
8932746,138781399,2017-03-21,25689405,Chelsi,"This is a GREAT location. Photos in the listing are not of the same flat. En suite bathroom a little small and dingy. The heater in one bedroom didn't seem to work well and would get chilly at night. But generally speaking, for the price, the location and flat can't be beat!!! "
8932746,141107603,2017-04-02,22846695,Matthew,"Everything was as described, location is great."
8932746,142477722,2017-04-08,26376081,Pascal,"Localisation, localisation ! L'appartement de Paula est idéalement situé et convient jusqu'à 6 personnes avec ses 2 salles de bains, 2 grandes chambres et un séjour lumineux donnant sur Covent Garden. Évidemment c'est un peu bruyant, mais vous êtes au centre de toute la vie nocturne de Londres, de ses pubs et des quartiers les plus animés. Paula s'est rendue disponible et arrangeante afin de nous accueillir plus tôt que prévu et nous l'en remercions encore. Literie parfaite et équipements de qualité pour un séjour inoubliable à Londres. Je recommande vivement! "
8932746,146945345,2017-04-24,100921481,Patrick,"Paula ist eine sehr freundliche und zuverlässige Gastgeberin. Sie antwortete immer sehr prompt und man kann sich auf ihr Wort verlassen: Aufgrund der Verspätung unseres Fluges konnten wir die ursprüngliche Check-In Zeit nicht einhalten und Paula war sehr bestrebt eine alternative Übergabe der Schlüssel zu organisieren. Schliesslich war es einer von Paulas Freunden der uns die Wohnung übergab.<br/><br/>Das Apartment liegt nur ca. 2 Gehminuten von der Tube Station ""Leicester Square"" entfernt über einem Pub. Ein Supermarkt befindet sich gerade auf der anderen Strassenseite.<br/><br/>Aufgrund der Lage (mitten in der Ausgehmeile) kann es am Abend, insbesondere an Wochenenden, bis spät am Abend laut sein. Leider sind die Fenster mässig (wärme- und) schallisoliert weshalb man mit gewissen Immissionen rechnen muss. Während unseres Aufenthaltes funktionierte die Heizung nicht richtig, wodurch es eher kühler war.<br/><br/>Ein grosses Plus ist neben der Lage allerdings die Sauberkeit und Ausstattung. Bei der Ankunft war es sehr sauber, auch die Küchenutensilien, Bäder und Duschen, sowie Toiletten waren in einwandfrei sauberen Zustand.<br/><br/>Wir würden jedoch wieder in die Wohnung Paulas kommen!"
8932746,147486022,2017-04-27,64012225,Debbie,"The apartment is ideally situated for a visit to London.  Central, and in a vibey area.  A Tesco supermarket is across the road which is open till 22:00.  Close to tubes. Big bedrooms. Good bathrooms.  Stairs a bit narrow and 2 flights to carry up bags but this is well known before hand. Very little noise comes through the double glazing.  Check  out times are strict (as stated) so can be a little tricky when travelling onward.  Would recommend this apartment and would book it again."
8932746,151272917,2017-05-12,108520891,Anne,"Thanks Paula, the location and apartment are fantastic. Close walking distance to all the key spots in London. Really enjoyed our stay."
8932746,154328880,2017-05-24,119357804,Carl,"Nice place.  Location is a big pro, but also a con. Great access to lots of key sites, but next to 3 pubs and a supermarket. Saturday night was a bit noisy, but not that big a deal. The supermarket is a. it annoying because their first delivery is around 4:30-5:00AM and they were  noisy enough to wake those in the master bedroom.  The other bedroom was not affected."
8932746,161185572,2017-06-17,105967311,Lina,The flat is really well located. It is surprinsingly spacious and was clean and comfortable upon arrival. Walking distance to touristic sites in london and metro station nearby. Communication with host was easy and she answered really quickly. If we return tu london will definitely book again! 
8932746,164652843,2017-06-28,89929517,Norman,"The location of this airbnb is fantastic!  It's close to everything!  Short and easy walk to bars, restaurants, underground, Covent Garden and Oxford Street...  We have a party of 5 and it worked out great.  It's located above a pub so it will get noisy before midnight.  Overall, we all love this place.  "
8932746,166746101,2017-07-04,133687279,Seniya,The apartment is very well managed and perfectly located: so handy to all the wonderful sights of London.<br/>A most memorable stay.
8932746,173872978,2017-07-24,128752491,Marion,Great place to stay. Very spacious and clean. Great amenities. Centrally place for exploring London. <br/><br/>Highly recommended 
8932746,204039295,2017-10-16,128831095,Andrea,We had a great stay at Paula’s flat! Location was perfect! A group of 6 girls stayed for a week and there was enough room to accommodate the group comfortably. Beware of the narrow flight of stairs though! The flat was clean and tidy! Tesco right across the street and Covent Garden a stones throw away!
8932746,271818115,2018-06-02,120213913,Laci,Nice place to stay in good location.
8932746,294580048,2018-07-22,31812904,Josephine,"Wonderful spacious flat, bang in the heart of London. We loved having access by foot to all the sights, theatres and shopping. Highly recommended."
8932746,299698602,2018-07-31,160564654,Gabriela,"Todo muy prolijo ,  pulcro y cómodo. El apartamento fue aun mas grande de lo que mis padres esperaban por las fotos publicadas. Exelente su ubicacion. Lo unico que puede afectar es algo del ruido de los alrededores. Muchas gracias Paula."
8932746,316359084,2018-08-31,2709235,Leo,Fantastic location and modern flat
8932746,321496453,2018-09-10,5756201,DArren,"Paula’s flat is in a fantastic location, right in the heart of Covent Garden London. We spent the weekend there and walked everywhere as it was so central. The flat has all the things you need. As it is so central is can be a bit noisy at night or first thing in the morning with deliveries to businesses around it. It didn’t bother us at all though but worth mentioning for others. I would recommend Paula’s flat for anyone looking to stay centrally in London."
8932746,323284555,2018-09-15,195078652,Lowell,"The check in/ check out process was superbly organized and efficient. <br/>The location is an ideal stepping off point for most sights in London, plenty of restaurants and shops nearby and a Tesco directly beside. <br/>Cabs are easy to hail here.<br/>My only gripe would be that we could have used a few more towels and some face cloths, and a clothes drier would have helped.<br/>The place was clean and tidy and provided a welcome abode after a full day in the city."
8932746,335479665,2018-10-12,9712225,Valerie,"This flat seems to be owned and operated by a Central booking service.   There is absolutely nothing that says ‘Paula’, or  ‘personal’ in the space.  Nothing.  Sparsely furnished, though adequate (beds, tables, chairs).  In our view, nothing that says ‘home’.  That said, the location is perfect.  Lots of activity and noise right outside and all night long.  Deliveries, tourists, taxis, socializing throughout the night.  Hot part of town.    If we were to visit London again, we would seek another airbnb flat within a 1/2 mile square area that has a homey - any kind of home - feel.   And quiet.   If not available, we would stay in a hotel.  Check-in (info; heat; access) were all problematic.  Unnecessary.  We appreciated the service company’s individual service people."
8932746,348339116,2018-11-13,37937832,Alana,Location - location - location.  Location and value were top notch.  Clean space with all the amenities you need.

8932746,362046016,2018-12-25,46697898,Meng Wei,Paula was very helpful and responsive. <br/>The location was super super super . U can walk to many places and save a heap on tube costs :) many many good places to eat  I can go on and on about the location but it really is unbeatable!<br/><br/>Other reviews have stated what I knew. That it’s on a 2nd floor so it is quite an effort to bring heavy bags to the apartment. And some nights it did get quite noisy from the nearby tesco doing its deliveries.<br/><br/>The apartment was clean and very liveable. Highly recommended.
8932746,368546453,2019-01-07,213615105,Yumiko,"The location is excellent.  Many touristic attractions are within walking distance or easy access via Leicester Square or Covent Garden tube stations.  Especially during this Christmas season, the view of illuminated King Street from dining/living room was very nice too.  We were not so much annoyed by some street noises because of the location.   All facilities/amenities we needed for our 8-night stay were well equipped, such as a good size table, proper chairs, washing machine with detergent, dishes, glasses, kitchen tools, dishwasher, and so on.  If music facility such as Bluetooth speaker is added, it would be perfect.  The responses from Paula to my questions were reasonably quick enough.  I want to thank her for our comfortable stay.   We definitely come back when needed."
8932746,400198824,2019-01-11,210338632,Marcus,Fantastic place to stay. Very clean and a great location. Very close to all the places you want and need to visit. Communication and assistance was fantastic and the whole trip was very easy and very nice. Thanks guys.

8932746,426829103,2019-03-22,58571839,Scott,"We are a family of five (three kids) and this was the perfect place for us. Plenty of room. Nicely appointed bathrooms and kitchen. The location is right in the heart of Covent Garden area (only a block from the market) and ideal as a home base for tourism. As other reviews have pointed out, the location is above a pub, so if your a light sleeper that could be an issue, but it caused no problem for any of us, including the kids. I highly recommend Paula and this place."

Shame weren’t able to drop off bags early, first time this has happened. Also think the fact we were 20 mins late checking out and an email threatening to charge me was a bit strong."
8932746,451263630,2019-05-11,5361394,Valeria,"The apartment is strategically located in Covent Garden with 3 min access to tube, shopping, pubs and cafes. Tesco is just cross the street. Pub is downstairs. <br/>The street is quite noisy with tesco deliveries early morning. Though if you have a good sleep, this won’t disturb.<br/>The host is very responsive and check in is very easy.<br/>Complimentary tea & coffee is available along with toiletries and washing liquids.<br/>Complimentary mid-stay cleaning available for a long stay.<br/>Good mattresses. Clean rooms.<br/>Unfortunately we had only one bathroom available for our stay, hope it will be fixed soon.<br/>Thank you for having us."

8932746,430913114211810896,2021-08-17,19189238,Sam,"Really happy with our stay in Covent Garden. Flat is good value for money, has everything you need for a short break, especially as you would generally eat out at a location like this. So many cafes and restaurants locally it’s silly! <br/>Flat is clean & tidy, a little noisy at night but one bedroom is better than the other for my children. The cot provided with bedding was perfect. <br/>Comms good from Stayco so very happy with everything."

Everything was spotlessly clean even met the cleaner on the way out ! Was a bit nervous about the security deposit as the website was a little vague but everything was fine and was returned. Communication with the stayo people was great with any questions they were able to get back in good time.

Heating wasn't working in the kitchen/diner and it was cold. Stairs are difficult, especially with luggage, but this is noted in the description. Two groups staying in the top apartment we're trying to enter ours late at night (not believing they had to go up even more stairs)."
8932746,499814356104138156,2021-11-20,155151758,Laura,Great apartment. Very central and lovely and clean. The stairs to access the apartment are very narrow but we were made aware of the stairs before our visit.

It was close to transport, shops and cafes. I also appreciated the breakfast cereals, teas and coffees they offered. Very thoughtful. I'd definitely return! Thank you Judith and Luis"
8985477,54020637,2015-11-15,47546129,Mathias,"We booked a 4 nights visit. Luis was here when we arrived at midday. He showed us the big and beautiful home in a very quiet neighborhood. The house is like 5-10 minutes from Kings Cross. All the house is new and really well arranged. <br/>We had a beautiful room, small but nice, and we share bathroom and toilets if just an another room, which is very pleasant because it's not with all the house. <br/>Breakfast is included and you can use kitchen whenever you want to eat. <br/>Luis gives us his phone number when we arrived so we could call him for any advices. <br/>From the house you can go whenever you want in London in 10-15 minutes with the tube which is awesome. <br/>In conclusion a great host and I will definitely recommend this house and if I come back I will book it again. <br/><br/>"

The room was easy to  Luis was here to greet us.<br/>Appartment shared by many visitors, more akin to an hostel than to a lodge.<br/><br/>They weren't really present, but we had access to the kitchen so all in all, it was fine.<br/><br/>We recommend for a short stay, but it's more in the idea of an hostel than a house."

The appartment is clean and fully equipped, and we got breakfast whith the cereals, fruits and milk provided. My son was worried about the shared bathrooms (!), but there are enough toilets for everybody. We liked the neighbourhood as well, close to Angel and its bustling life."

The room was honestly bigger than I expected, as ""cosy"" usually means ""micro.""  The bed was big enough for two, comfy and made up nicely, and the room still had space for a desk and a wardrobe.  The house itself has recently been done up to a very high standard and is in a fantastic location.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

Luis provided a brief tour, was very accommodating with my check out time, and very communicative- he always responded within a reasonable amount of time and was never hard to reach. Overall, the apartment was clean, tidy, and stocked with snacks. There are a few other people who share the apartment as well, either other tenants or Airbnb guests, so if you're looking for complete privacy and not just a private room, that is something to consider. Even so, I had a great experience. Thank you! "

He was there when I arrived, showing me around the house, and made me feel at home. Everything was very clean. The location was convenient to either walk or take public transportation anywhere I wanted to go. The kitchen was stocked with coffee, tea, and lovely fresh fruit, cereals, and milk. The wifi worked very well, a bit plus for me, as I was there to work, not vacation. I recommend without hesitation."
8985477,95620345,2016-08-20,33572104,Yadvender Singh,Amazing place. Best host you can have. Very central location. 
8985477,96476992,2016-08-23,90782789,Angie,"Had a great and comfortable stay in London.  Loved the location super close to kings crossing which made it extremely easy for my husband and I to walk early morning and late evening.  Nice neighborhood and wonderful hosts.  Instantly felt welcomed after a 9 hour flight.  Showered (separate toilet room was excellent). Comfy pillows, window in bedroom, clean, and private.  Would gladly recommend to family and friends visiting London.  Guys were super friendly and a pleasure to meet.  Safe travels everyone and enjoy."

8985477,101430523,2016-09-13,6423213,Roberta,"Camera pulita e accogliente in una zona molto tranquilla. A disposizione c'è una cucina molto attrezzata con doppio lavandino, doppi fuochi, doppi forni, i bagni della casa sono molti quindi non c'è mai stato problema di trovarli occupati. King's Cross si trova a 15min a piedi (o a  5 min in bus), a 5 min c'è la zona di Exmouth market piena di bei locali e ristoranti lontano dalla confusione delle zone più turistiche, da lì con 10 min di bus (19 e 38) si raggiunge la zona di Leicester square/Piccadilly.<br/>Gli host sono stati molto disponibili e forniscono risposta immediata.<br/>Sicuramente consiglio di soggiornare qui."

8985477,112719037,2016-11-07,41477274,Ville,"Checking in and out were very flexible. <br/>The neighbourfood was charming and very peaceful. A great (=good food) Vietnamese restaurant nearby, called Sen Viet. <br/>The walk from King´s Cross station was a bit annoying (10-15 min) when tired and wet but the location was clearly announced in the description.<br/>It was great that there was complimentary fresh fruit, cereal, tea and coffee. <br/>The room was quite small for two people. There wasn´t a lot of places where to hang our towels, clothes or other things.<br/>I think there were three bathrooms in the appartment and it wasn´t a problem during our stay, they were always available."
8985477,113911522,2016-11-14,16425272,Mayra,La casa è facilmente raggiungibile coi mezzi ed è in un ottima zona. Vi sono diverse stanze (non si è gli unici ospiti della casa) e i servizi sono in comune ma è tutto tenuto molto in ordine. La cucina è il punto forte della casa. Abbiamo incontrato solo Ricardo che è stato un padrone di casa eccellente
8985477,114290623,2016-11-17,29656256,Ângela,"The house was really near to Kings Cross station. <br/>There were lots of buses to the city center. <br/>The house was really clean, very cousy and welcoming, the only thing we notice was a little noise because off the subway that passes really near, but the windows cover much of the noise. <br/>Ricardo was really welcoming. <br/>The check-in and check out was really easy and we could do it at the hour that suits us the most. <br/>There was breakfast available and it had a variaty of things. <br/>Very good experience "
8985477,114779221,2016-11-20,53964799,Maria,"We enjoyed our stay at Luis' and Ricardo's very much. We arrived way too late due to a delayed flight and we had forgotten an adapter. Both did not pose any problem. Ricardo was very flexible and always ready to help us. The rooms were very nice and clean. There are more than one bathroom, so there were no problems in this regard either. The flat is very nicly located and public transport to the city centre, Kings Cross and to Camden Town is very close by. Exmouth market with nice cafes is in walking distance."

Wir hatten Zimmer Nr.3 was voll seinen Zweck erfüllt hat, unter anderem genügend Ablagefläche, Steckdosen und einen Schrank. Wir teilten das WC und Bad mit dem Nebenzimmer was kein Problem war, war alles sauber. Im unteren Stock befinde sich eine große Doppelküche, Esstisch und Wohn-/Aufenthaltszimmer. Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet, Müsli, Milch, Kaffee so wie frisches Obst steht zur Verfügung. Aufgrund der recht Zentralen Lage haben wir London ausschließlich mit den ""Santander"" Fahrrädern die es überall in der Stadt gibt erkundet (nächste Station von der Wohnung ca. 2min zu Fuß entfernt).<br/>In dem Haus gibt es 7 Zimmer auf unserem Stock waren 2 Zimmer wir haben aber von den anderen nicht viel mitbekommen. <br/><br/>Wir hatten eine sehr schöne Zeit bei Luis<br/>Wir kommen gerne wieder.<br/>"

Easy access to the 63 and 17 bus, underground at either Kings Cross or Russel square, and trains at Kings Cross. It's also a very easy walk to Covenant Garden area, River Thames, and more. The shared kitchen, living room, and bathroom (there were multiple bathrooms and showers) were kept clean and well stocked with toiletries, food (fresh fruit, cereal, and milk), and dishes.

Les lieux sont propres, il y a plusieurs toilettes et douches, la cuisine est grande est bien équipé, on a même accès aux machines à laver au besoin. Petit bémol sur le parquet qui grince, du coup on entend quand les autres personnes marchent à proximité. On entend aussi un peu le train mais pas de quoi empêcher de dormir la nuit. Rapport qualité prix très correct"

Usually there are several people staying there, but there are plenty of bathrooms, so it wasn't a problem for us. The location is very convenient, about 10 minutes walking distance from King's Cross. In case you are easily bothered by noise, keep in mind that you can hear subway trains every few minutes from inside the house. The noise is not loud, it's more of a background thing."

8985477,215930009,2017-12-02,160475547,Craig,"Really enjoyed my short stay here. The price was much cheaper than any of the surrounding hotels and the location was good, only a 15 minute walk from Kings Cross. The house was clean and there were plenty of amenities. I also enjoyed chatting to the other guests in the communal area. I think the house may be over the tube as I could hear something that sounded like trains passing by so I would recommend bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper. However there were noise dampeners on the windows and I could not hear the noise with earplugs in so I had a great nights sleep."
8985477,216541546,2017-12-04,33893547,Camille,"Tres bon sejour chez Luis et Ricardo!<br/><br/>Dans un jolie maison typique londonienne, une chambre simple et propre nous attendait. La salle de bain petite mais fonctionnelle est au 2 pas ( au sens propre) avec des wc séparés, les deux à partager avec  seule autre chambre. <br/>Les hotes ont étés reactifs et discrets, nous les remercions encore de nous avoir gardé nos bagages afin que nous puissions profiter sereinement de notre dernier jour.<br/>Le petit bemol reste le bruit de train décrit dans l'annonce. Présent sans pour autant empecher de dormir, il ne nous empêchera pas de revenir lors de notre prochain escapade!"
8985477,216730885,2017-12-05,22469584,Sanjay,Safe and quiet location. House is large and well equipped with a nice garden. Good transport links . Great stay!
8985477,216886649,2017-12-06,38290540,Alexandra,"Ricardo welcomed me nicely and showed me the entire place. It was really nice and clean and the area was nice too.<br/><br/>To have coffee, tea, cereals and fruits there for us was a great plus !"
8985477,217059311,2017-12-07,40293870,Kamal,"Great place - as described.<br/>A little bedsit like, but great kitchen and shared lounge.<br/>Room and bathroom etc were nice and clean.<br/>Great value.<br/>Will stay again."
8985477,217799059,2017-12-10,98491184,Paul,Very nice location 10mn by walking from saint Pancras (but very quiet)<br/>The apartment is shared with other hosts (each having their room but sharing bathroom). Everything was clean and cozy. Due to the closeness of the room you can hear a bit the other room. There was a heater in a room which was nice because of the cold.<br/>Luis was very friendly and accomodating with us leaving our luggage until our train. There is a big kitchen downstairs where you have your breakfast (milk and cereals are provided).
8985477,218383103,2017-12-12,21045808,Michael,"Very convenient to Kings Cross and Central London  yet very quiet, which is my main priority. Very simple but comfortable."
8985477,218662534,2017-12-14,149666534,Susannah,Great location location for me walking distance to the office.  Great room everything I needed.
8985477,219637080,2017-12-18,149685787,Thom,"The reception was excellent and we felt welcome right away. We could leave our bags even though we arrived in the early morning, that gave us the chance to explore the city in the meanwhile.<br/>We started our mornings with the complementary breakfast, which where great to have, the location was ideal to start our daily visits to the city center via bus or underground and took about 35 minuted including walking and both the rooms and the showers/toilets where very clean and well maintained.<br/><br/>Overall we can only say that the accommodation was perfect for us!<br/><br/>Thank you Luis & Ricardo for your great hospitality."
8985477,220209718,2017-12-21,24603851,Majella,"Great space huge kitchen, great shower. Well organized. Perfect place to stay."

8985477,226385914,2018-01-10,131832787,Sion,"It was a great experience. The house is super central. If I go back to London, they would be my first choice. The ratio quality/price was excellent. "
8985477,227526822,2018-01-15,20280798,Jan,Great location near Kings Cross.  Generous fruit and breakfast cereals provided.   Very friendly and obliging host. A caring and considerate environment.
8985477,229221905,2018-01-22,20280798,Jan,"Great location. Friendly host, easy living space, plenty of breakfast fruit options."
8985477,229562509,2018-01-24,131832787,Sion,It was as nice as ever. It is the second time and I would recommend it to anybody. 
8985477,229936862,2018-01-26,20280798,Jan,Very friendly host.  Ideal location for Kings<br/>Cross area.
8985477,230140438,2018-01-27,76206174,Jana,Good location and fast Wi-Fi
8985477,231068023,2018-01-30,124287761,Pilar,"Los anfitriones fueron amables y atentos, estuvieron a nuestro servicio siempre que los necesitamos. La habitación y las instalaciones estaban muy limpias y bien decoradas y estaba bien comunicado en transporte público con todos los monumentos y lugares de interés de Londres. <br/><br/>Sin duda una experiencia totalmente recomendable!"
8985477,232271872,2018-02-04,163300856,Laura,"Great location,nicely furnished house,everything was clean. Luis and Ricardo were always there to help with any question. Hope we will be back soon!"
8985477,232808428,2018-02-06,81433902,Mike,"I have stayed here before so I know the area, the square, the property and the hosts.  All good, Luis was very responsive and good communication.  Would always come back and recommend to future a guests."
8985477,233868172,2018-02-11,149525004,Erika,"We stayed there over the weekend and had a great time. Location is easy to find and relatively close to the center. Check in was very easy, Luis showed me around and offered local tips. We could use a huge shared kitchen and living room in addition to bedroom. Breakfast was offered in a form of fruits and cereal. Overall, very good experience. Definitely recommend staying there!"
8985477,234608330,2018-02-13,2882765,Erin,"We spent two nights in one of Luis’ rooms! Check-in was incredibly easy, and Luis responded quickly and was flexible when our check-in time had to change. We were able to check-in in the middle of the day at the time of our choosing, which was very convenient since we just had a long flight and a lot of baggage. The room is pretty small and simple, but comfortable enough. We shared a very tiny bathroom and shower with other travelers staying in the room next door, but it was never an issue. There were many amenities downstairs, including a full kitchen and TV room, but we didn’t end up having the time to indulge in them. The building is in a quiet neighborhood about a 13–15 min walk to/from King’s Cross, so something to keep in mind if you are looking to be closer to the tube. However, King’s Cross is a huge transportation hub that will easily take you to many of the main sights of London, so it’s convenient to be close to, even if it feels like a bit of a walk at the end of the night! <br/><br/>Thanks Luis & friends for an enjoyable experience!"
8985477,237018711,2018-02-21,113439285,Adrian,"Desde el momento que entramos quedamos encantados con el alejamiento y sus servicios. Luis siempre fue muy amable. Ofrecen frutas, cafe, cereales y leche para el deayuno sin ningun costo adicional. La cocina es de uso general para todos los huespeded pero nunca tuvimos que compartirla. La ubicacion es a 8 cuadras de king cross, fuimos y volvimos caminando con las valijas, respecto a las principales atracciones está un poquito alejada pero no fue un problema pq el transporte publico es excelente. El baño es compartido pero siempre estuvo limpio y nunca nos cruzamos con nadie."
8985477,242197740,2018-03-11,122892744,Gusts,"First of all - a really nice host - always smiling and really helpful. Great location - 10min walk from Kings Cross station - from there you can get anywhere on tube (there's also bus stop just outside the house, but we never used that). Cosy typical London house with multiple rooms for multiple guests - large kitchen with all the necessary appliances and, of course, fresh fruits, cereal, tea and milk! The only thing that I might add as unpleasant (at first) is that there is a tube line opening near the house, so you can hear the trams goin by every minute, but they stop at midnight. Luis was kind enough to offer us ear-plugs for better sleep, but I took a more medical approach with a couple of beers :) Overall it's a great place for the price - I would definitely recommend."
8985477,245207974,2018-03-21,39598390,Jamie,"A great price, in a great location for Clerkenwell/Farringdon. Would certainly recommend for any one-two night trips to the city."
8985477,247085185,2018-03-27,28835539,Pierre,"Logement bien agencé, pensé pour les voyageurs. Relativement calme bien que suffisamment central. Chambre relativement petite mais correcte, cuisine immense !<br/>Luis a été très réactif pour ce qui est du départ et de l’arrivée. A recommander"
8985477,248780256,2018-04-01,14836476,Katrina,Room is in a great location. Luis was very clear in all communications and thoughtful regarding our stay. Thanks Luis!
8985477,265456066,2018-05-17,34543029,Brian,This was a cozy spot to stay near Kings Cross and Exmouth Market. The backyard is very nice and the kitchen is fully stocked.
8985477,266157542,2018-05-19,1816671,Edzus,"Great location, not far from Kings Cross and with fully equipped kitchen we felt like at home."
8985477,267300108,2018-05-21,23569347,Daphney,"I loved how close this place was to Kings Cross and public transportation. It is very clean and convenient to get to. There was a wall charge converter provided, which was perfect because my mom and I brought the wrong converters. Luis was fast to respond and was very hospitable. I recommend this place and will plan to use it in the future."
8985477,268262004,2018-05-24,128631858,Andres,The host allowed us to drop the baggage’s prior to the check in time.  The apartment is very accurate to what it’s written and exactly as it’s shown on the pictures . 
8985477,271484562,2018-06-01,29408789,Melissa,"Luis was kind enough to let me into my room early, which after a long day of traveling is very appreciated. Everything was clean and tidy. Great shared areas. A little bit of a wall to the tube, but there is a bus stop out front. Would recommend."
8985477,272160117,2018-06-03,1562088,Melissa,Great place. 10 min walk from King’s Cross which was really convenient. Nice little neighborhood and easy to get to buses. Room was as described and nice little touches like water and glasses on the bedside table. Would stay here again! 
8985477,274115459,2018-06-08,101128967,Anishka,"Great place near Kings Cross. There was cereal and fresh fruit available in the big kitchen which had everything necessary to prepare a meal. Location was great, a 10 minute walk to Kings Cross station. There was also a bus stop right outside. Luis was very quick to respond when we had any questions. "
8985477,275086544,2018-06-10,36124244,Paolo,"Luis was very gentle and fast to answer for any question we had. Additionally, he was very flexible and we could leave our luggages after the check out. Place was very well-located.  "
8985477,277014530,2018-06-15,27237943,María Eugenia,"La ubicación es muy buena porque King’s cross tiene conexiones con casi todas las líneas. <br/>El hospedaje es divino, decorado con muy buen gusto.<br/>Los baños se comparten con los demás, pero es casi como si fueran solo para vos (hay baño y ducha por piso).<br/>Definitivamente lo recomendamos!!"
8985477,282803397,2018-06-28,48546975,Amélia,"Luis was very kind and welcoming. The room is clean but little noise from the train.  Luis proposed us to drink coffee and eat something at the breakfast, very good! Thank you a lot for your hospitality "
8985477,293854913,2018-07-21,145188722,Eva,"It was already my second time at Louis place and I think I would even go there a 3rd time! The area the house is located in is really quite and safe, nevertheless there are multiple bus stops and of course king's cross just a few minutes walking away. We had everything we needed "
8985477,297223409,2018-07-27,34546090,Zarinar,"Luis is an excellent and efficient host. Though the room’s a little small for 2 people with 2 luggages (not to mention 4...), Luis made it up with his genuine hospitality and was kind to provide fruits and light breakfast such as cereals and hot chocolate. Do note that the toilet size is rather small so I wouldn’t recommend it for people who are claustrophobic. Overall, Luis’ place was clean and accessible. It’s just 2-3 bus stops away from King Cross Station. His place was indeed a home away from home. Thank you Luis :’)"
8985477,304744629,2018-08-10,67807244,Caroline,"We spent three nights here and enjoyed the very spacious kitchen, the large and comfortable shared living room and the clean organized space. Our host Luis was very accommodating with a late check in time. The courtyard entry from the street has beautiful trees and we felt very safe and comfortable here. We would recommend it.  "
8985477,315304109,2018-08-28,34594244,Na,房子坐落于位于国王十字圣潘克拉车站走路15分钟的位置，小区附近十分安静。但是最好早点回家。房东十分热情，也待客有道，我特别喜欢底楼的客厅和厨房，设施便利温馨，有机会还会入住。

8985477,322918437,2018-09-14,152794341,Nina,"Das Zimmer und das Badezimmer auf diesem Stockwerk waren etwas klein, dafür war die Küche sehr groß. Gute Anbindung an die U-Bahn, dafür hört man aber auch die vorbeifahrenden Züge."
8985477,324987214,2018-09-18,189108317,Hannah,"this place is great for what it is. it's nothing fancy, but for these prices you shouldn't be expecting fancy. place was clean. we never had a problem with privacy or noisy neighbors. we felt safe and secure. and the location is FANTASTIC. if your looking for a short stay in London with an easy location for getting around the city, this place works just great."

8985477,368556624,2019-01-07,14565361,Nasri,"I have stayed at this house before in different rooms and Luis & Ricardo have become my friends. I don’t want to look at other housing options before coming to London because I know they can help me out. The house gives you everything, and although the hosts might sometimes be busy they will always do their best to help you. Hopefully it won’t be long before I come back!"
8985477,369390603,2019-01-10,234844801,Kristina,The space is exactly as shown. Very quiet shared space with other guests and was clean. There are clean linens provided and breakfast foods along with fruit in the kitchen.

Lots of cafes and shops around. <br/>I walked to the city center. <br/>The room is small, but you can use the kitchen and the living room downstairs and that was very nice. It is quite noisy in the room during the day because you can hear trains, but it didnt bother me at night<br/>There are other guests in the house. <br/>Everything is decorated very thoughtfully. And generally everything is thought through for the guests in the house.<br/>Kitchen is big and perfectly equipped. There are fruits in the kitchen which was amazing. <br/>Communication with Luis was easy and nice. <br/>I would recommend this place to anyone and stay here again"
8985477,406101998,2019-01-28,195169092,Randy,"nice house! however as an asthma sufferer it was a bit to dusty with all the carpet and tapestry. If you get lucky you might see wild foxes running through the park in front at night. The owners respond quickly and are very accomodating. You can hear the trains, but we got used to them fairly quick"
8985477,407525692,2019-02-02,4283605,Cydy,"Wondeful place, great location, close to restaurants, very clean, communication was prompt. The room is just a little chilly."

Then, the house itself is big, well-equiped, really nice. Luis himself is a very charming host, responsive and diligent. I would definitely recommend staying at his place, and would come back to his place when I'm back in London !"

8985477,431027311,2019-03-31,214240611,Eunjin,큰 캐리어 두개 펼치면 공간이 끝날 정도로 둘이 쓰기에 약간 협소하긴 하지만 나름 지낼만 합니다. 위치는 킹스크로스까지 걸어서 15분 정도 거리긴 한데 큰 불만은 없었어요. 다만 밤늦게 숙소로 올때 좀 무서울 수는 있어요. 숙소 관리가 잘 되는거 같고 부엌이랑 공용공간이 쾌적하고 좋아요. 화장실과 샤워실도 층마다 있고 세탁기와 세제도 무료이용 가능하고! 부엌에서 과일과 커피 우유 시리얼 등을 무료로 이용할수 있어요. 런던 중심가에 이 정도 서비스 이정도 가격이면 최고 아닐까 싶습니다. 추천해요!
8985477,431996308,2019-04-02,185451668,星禹,非常方便，服务周到
8985477,437131679,2019-04-14,23776231,Riccardo,Luis’s place was the perfect spot for a weekend in London. My girlfriend and I did not meet Luis but communication was excellent. We found the keys in a box because we arrived very late over night. Everything went smoothly well. The only small issue we had was the bathroom (the one next to our room was a little bit small) but compared with hostel’s prices in the area and everything it was a great deal for a quick weekend in London. I would highly recommend Luis’s place.
8985477,444145807,2019-04-27,93833103,Ariel,"Tuvimos una excelente estadía en este hospedaje. La comunicación y el trato con Luis fueron excelentes. La ubicación cerca de King Cross vale mucho la pena. La casa es bellisima, con detalles para sentirte en tu casa, súper comoda. Desayuno más que suficiente. Puedes cocinar lo que quieras. Todo limpio y cuidado. La habitación está impecable.<br/>Muy agradecidos porque en pocos lugares te sientes tan cómodo como en tu casa.<br/>Recomiendo 100% este hospedaje en caso de no poder alojarte en un apartamento entero, sin duda volvería.<br/>Saludos!<br/>Ariel y Carolina."
8985477,446868722,2019-05-02,46547500,Thibaut,"Le logement de Luis est accessible très rapidement à pieds depuis King's Cross (10min). De plus, le logement est propre et Luis mets à disposition le nécessaire pour un séjour confortable. Néanmoins la proximité du métro peut par moment être dérangeante par son bruit important."

Super responsive, extremely helpful and nice :-) <br/>I can only recommend this place! <br/>We stayed in a different room this time which was a bit smaller but as described and it’s still fine for a few days. <br/>All was clean and nicely decorated. Also Luis provides breakfast incl. fresh fruits which is awesome. <br/>I will definitely come back the next time when visiting London!"

El host super amable y habla en inglés y español. En la casa había un montón de detalles que la hacían cálida y cómoda. 10 puntos la cama y ducha!Super recomendable!"
8985477,467967526,2019-06-11,227420943,Inga,"Luis is really nice and friendly, reacts in messages a bit slow, but ok. Good check in and check out. The room small, but enaugh space for couple - we only rested at night in there - all day exploring London. A bit noisy - you can hear the tube, luckilly on Sunday it was really quiet, you can even hear the birds singing. A bit far from tube station - 15-20 min. on foot. It is a lot when you are tired after all day walking around. The was always fruits, granola, cerials, milk and honey, tea, cofee - this was very nice! They recycle litter - also nice. But... Kitchen was always smelly from someone’s cooking, greasy pan and other stuf. Old house - you can hear while somebody is walking in coridors. All in all a nice place if you are not willing to cook and you like walk a lot :)"

Our bedroom was close to the bathroom and always clean, just like the whole apartment. Luis and Ilona are always open to help and if you need anything they will surely make a way to solve things for you. The location is great, easy to access and lot of public transport around. Thank you for everything! <br/>Best Wishes, Mayumi and Canato."
8985477,457720429697751282,2021-09-23,271390848,Mariflo,"Perfect place to stay !!! Great location , Clean and comfortable ."
8985477,459928924237828133,2021-09-26,18593935,Joanna,"Before my arrival, my communication with Luis was very warm and friendly and informative.  He let me know that he was expecting me, and I continued to keep him updated with changes in my plans throughout the day.  This accommodation was truly the most cosy environment that I've stayed in within the Greater London area.  I was so impressed with the amount of common space that guests were given liberty to use, including the comfy couches in the living room and 10-seater long wooden table in the dining room area, use of the beautiful well-groomed garden, an incredibly well-stocked full sized kitchen with a central island with bar stools and cooking facilities and everything you could possibly need to cater for yourself and your party as if it were a fully-furnished efficiency apartment.  I didn't have time to go grocery shopping, but I did order sushi from a nearby restaurant through Deliveroo.  I used the plates and glasses and cutlery from the kitchen, and it truly felt like ordering out and eating in from home, as I watched an evening film on the large screen telly.   Everything was SO clean and new.  It seems this accommodation was recently remodelled, with fresh paint and tapestries and furniture.  There were scented oil diffusers in every room that kept everything smelling so fresh!  Disposable masks were available for guests, but were not required.  All guests were asked to remove their shoes if they wished to go to the downstairs level where the common rooms are located.  It looks like the carpeting is brand new, too!  There were many lovely paintings and wall hangings and vases of flowers and mirrors that added to the warmth and décor.  I stayed in Room #3, and there was more than enough space for my suitcase and clothes in the double wardrobe, along with a hair dryer in the bedside stand and kettle on the top with two mugs and  complimentary coffee/tea on the serving tray.  The bed was super comfortable with plenty of pillows.  The window was frosted which allowed full daylight in whilst still maintaining privacy from the nearby neighbours.  The drawn curtains blocked out all light at night, and allowed me to sleep very soundly both nights of my stay.  Although it wasn't an en suite room, there were only two rooms (#2 and #3) on that floor that shared a common toilet that was separate from the shower and sink.  Loads of extra blankets and pillows were available in the alcove of the same hallway, and the well-lit hallway made it easy to find everything you needed, such as extra blankets and pillows if you required.  Although this location is very near the local underground and Luis and Iona offered all guests foam earplugs (in case you're a light sleeper), I honestly didn't mind the gentle rumbling of the trains that passed every 10 minutes or so.  It just felt like ""white noise"" to me, which I would expect in a large city such as Greater London.  Luis' and Iona's directions were spot on, in how to get from King's Cross Underground directly to the accommodations.  It's located in a quiet neighbourhood around a green square in the centre where there is a lovely children's playground.  I felt very safe and cared for in this place, and I was warmly welcomed by both of my hosts.  They are lovely, good-hearted people, and I will definitely return to this location in the future.  This is a true, undiscovered gem, and I so wish them well in great success for many years of good business to come."
8985477,467906740409024079,2021-10-07,10832106,Abi,Lovely stay - very accommodating and great to have the use of all the kitchen facilities. Appreciated luis stayed up late to welcome me :) thank you!
8985477,493272337314199243,2021-11-11,144254907,William,"A nice alternative to regular chain hotels with clean, characterful rooms and a large shared kitchen. Luis was very friendly and helpful. Be aware that you can hear the sound of trains passing in some rooms which didn't bother us much (it was actually quite relaxing) but plenty of earplugs are provided if you want to block that out. We would stay again."
8985477,493982139644551749,2021-11-12,253873740,Róisín,"beautiful house in a quiet neighbourhood but with good bus links and a short walk from angel and kings cross, was perfect for my partner and i who were only in london for a night because we had the whole city on our doorstep. luis was friendly and helpful, made us feel at home, and the room was really pretty. lovely garden to have a glass of wine in and cereal provided at breakfast - a great stay, thank you :)"

Flat is spacious, light and comfortable and comes with everything that you could need!<br/><br/>Host James is very responsive, easy to contact and will reply very quickly!<br/><br/>Would definitely stay here again, thank you very much! "
9111194,55458723,2015-12-01,48488062,David,"Very welcoming host, lovely and home and great communication. Location is good, next to a small park with great views of London. Received email ahead of stay with all information we needed. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend."
9111194,57678562,2015-12-28,49708607,John,"The description of the flat on the website matched the reality. There was a welcome bottle of wine. The accommodation was just what we wanted but there were some niggles. The bath plug got stuck in the bath and prevented the water from draining. This was fixed the next day.  The TV didn't receive terrestrial channels in the living room and had to be re-sited to the dining/kitchen and retuned.  There was no cafetière or percolator for coffee.<br/>James was very responsive to the plug problem, but the other issues need to be sorted quickly"
9111194,58557041,2016-01-03,5460072,Hélène,"La maison de James et Sophie est très chaleureuse, spacieuse, très bien rangée et très accueillante. Nous n'avons malheureusement pas rencontré James et Sophie, mais leur accueil , vin et Haribos compris, a eu un grand succès! Merci à eux pour cette attention!"
9111194,72127012,2016-05-01,58872907,Jonas Flem,We really enjoyed staying at James’ apartment. It was very cozy and nice and clean. The area is a hidden gem in London with a spectacular view of the city of London and Canary Wharf.  I can highly recommend it. 
9111194,75842801,2016-05-23,71866690,Suzanne,"Simply, we were very happy with everything about the flat.  <br/>James was helpful in terms of checking in and out times, and giving us his number for any queries throughout our stay.  We used to live in the area, so already know that it is a nice place to live, close to central London but not too close.  However, the benefit of being right next to a park (with open views from the kitchen) is an incredible bonus which would definitely make us come back.  The hill up to it is a bit of a challenge but it's steep rather than long, so is over pretty quickly, and means you get great views.<br/>The flat is well laid out and furnished; smart and elegant but lived in (obviously!) so feels comfortable and easy to relax.   Particular favourites were the super king bed and the kitchen/diner - where we could have easily hosted friends.<br/>Searching to find something negative to say, there were a few lights not working and the bathroom is a bit of a squeeze, but nothing significant that affected our stay."
9111194,77305975,2016-05-31,13937479,Amy,"James' place was lovely. The space is quite spacious and felt very cozy. Not in central London but perfect if you'd like to experience a taste outside of your usual tourist route, plus it's very easy to get to the train station and access all of London. The neighborhood is beautiful and there are many small restaurants nearby which is very convenient! Overall a great stay!"
9111194,78295570,2016-06-06,44696826,Sasha,"The place was such a nice,  clean, cosy, lovely and comfortable.  It looks better in reality. We fell in love with the kitchen and their seasoning cupboard  "
9111194,82704865,2016-06-29,73268570,Marisa,"This was a great place to stay for me and my friends.  We were comfortably able to fit three people.  The kitchen was well stocked in regards to cooking utensils and spices.  The place was clean and James provided plenty of useful information for us before we got there.  The neighborhood felt safe and it was easy to get into London via the Overground.  <br/><br/>Only drawback is the hill the flat is on which is pretty steep, but it is also short so it was manageable.  "
9111194,83608711,2016-07-03,2908205,Shari,James left us a lovely note and a bottle of wine.  He also provided excellent information about the public transportation.  We asked a lot of questions!  Their place was absolutely ideal.  Just a short walk to the rail station to get into central London.

9111194,104360356,2016-09-26,84875286,Narin,"It was lovely to stay in James' house! It was cosy and comfortable. He left a nice welcoming message with a bottle of wine!

9111194,193169501,2017-09-12,91984475,Wendy,"This was our first Air BnB booking.  At first the feeling of being in someone else's space was a bit strange but we soon got over and loved the preview into their lives.  We enjoyed our weekend and everything we needed was available and clean.   The area was safe and loved the park right next to it.  Not too far from the tube but if you have a lot of luggage like we did, we would suggest you Uber because the last bit is a little steep.  Thank you James & Sophie.  :-)"

La pulizia era ottima  così  come anche l'ordine nella casa. <br/>Se c'è  tempo,  il parco dietro la  casa offre l'occasione per meravigiiose passeggiate  più  o meno lunghe,  magari il mattino o nel pomeriggio prima dell'imbrunire.<br/>È  da considerare buono anche il rapporto qualità/prezzo.<br/>Sono a disposizione diverse linee di autobus, che raggiungono in  tempi ragionevoli il centro di Londra o le principali attrazioni turistiche  attorno al Tamigi."

9111194,660572165,2020-09-05,5134986,Shu,"Such a beautiful flat next door to a wonderful park with absolutely breathtaking views of London day and night. But it's up a very very steep hill (important info for guests with disabilities especially). Spacious and perfect for small children as the flat is all on one level. <br/><br/>The bedrooms are huge, and the master-bedroom bed is a massive superking and so comfy. <br/><br/>The placement of the bathroom was a bit of an issue for us, being practically in the kitchen. Not a big deal if you're all super-familiar with each other, but a huge deal if you're not. We had to put on the extractor fan when using the bathroom (tmi I know - sorry!)<br/><br/>The flat felt more lived-in (actually felt like the hosts had just popped out for milk) than any other Airbnb we've stayed in. That's not a bad thing necessarily, just made use more aware it was another family's home. The plus side of that is that the flat feels full of love and warmth.<br/><br/>Access to the garden was blocked by a bike, which was a shame (I know we could have contacted host in effort to move it, but just didn't fancy dealing with that on our week away). <br/><br/>Some basics were missing/not quite right - like no cloth to wipe surfaces, no kitchen towel, and only 2 rolls of loo roll for a family of 4 for three nights. In the middle of a pandemic, a bit more emphasis on those things would have been appreciated. Again, I know we could have asked for more, but it was easier just to buy what we needed. <br/><br/>Overall a really nice stay, and we're grateful to James and Sophie for opening their home to us. Thanks!"

10408740,60295661,2016-01-21,5059207,Holly,"Joseph was the perfect host - his flat was super stylish and fully equipped with everything we needed for our stay. It was very handy for everywhere we wanted to be - Dalston and Shoreditch are just a short stroll away. Joseph was quick to respond to all enquiries, reliable and very friendly. We will definitely be back next time we are in London! Thanks for a great stay Joseph!"
10408740,67464915,2016-03-29,2904352,Megan,"Joseph's apartment in Haggerston, London was perfect! My friend and I stayed there for a month while we were working in London and immediately felt at home in the apartment. The transport links are great, there are tons of shops and restaurants around and Joseph was always super quick to respond to any questions we had. "
10408740,83610318,2016-07-03,29429871,Lucy,"Joseph's apartment was perfect for our requirements.<br/><br/>It was nice and clean with plenty of space for all guests and had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay.<br/><br/>Plenty of amenities nearby and a short walk to bars and restaurants in the area. The overground is literally a 2 minute walk away and plenty of buses run from the main road.<br/><br/>The apartment block is very secure and easy to find and Joseph was always on hand by phone if we needed anything at all. He met us when we arrived to show us around and how things worked.<br/><br/>All in all, could not have had a better experience staying in his stylish flat. I would highly recommend. "
10408740,93459818,2016-08-12,21715236,Wim,"Joseph was zelf niet aanwezig tijdens ons verblijf maar laat zich wel omringen door fantastische mensen die ervoor zorgen dat je aankomst en verblijf aangenaam verloopt. <br/>Hij was wel telkens via mail en telefoon direct aanspreekbaar. Helaas was er een probleem met het internet. Zowel hij als zijn entourage hebben er alles aan gedaan om het probleem te verhelpen. Het mocht niet baten, maar we waardeerden hun inspanningen enorm. <br/>Het appartement was perfect gelegen om London te verkennen. Het was steeds aangenaam thuiskomen na een vermoeiende dag. <br/>Zeker aan te raden als je niet direct in het drukke centrum van Londen wil verblijven, maar toch wil genieten van alle voorzieningen op wandelafstand. Bedankt Joseph!"

10914098,88026307,2016-07-22,51173266,Paul,"We were a party of five plus a six month old baby. Meet and greet went very smoothly and photos and description of the house were very accurate. The small toilet under the stairs had a ""Please do not use"" sign but with two other toilets this was not a problem for us. The neighborhood is very quiet (except at lunchtime when children play at the nearby school) and noise never disturbed us. A convenience store is close at hand along with cafes and restaurants; public transport is easily reached. Beds were very comfortable in the three double bedrooms and we used the single bedroom with a day bed as a peaceful study. We stayed during a hot spell but the house stayed comfortable and the backyard proved a huge bonus, especially for the baby. The internet was a bit erratic but their internet provider was having London wide problems during our stay. We recommend the house highly."

11003582,98892526,2016-09-02,92025972,Marc,"Our stay here was terrific. Great location just two minutes walking distance from Leicester Square tube station. Everything you could possibly need is provided, including towels, toothbrushes, maps of London, slippers, and you can even use the kitchen (fridge, etc.) to store food and drink if you need to (Note: the kitchen is shared). The other occupants are very quiet and keep to themselves and we found our stay here very comfortable and enjoyable. The only thing that I would say made us a bit less comfortable is that the apartment can get quite hot at night (we stayed here in August) - there is an air conditioning machine but even so. I'd recommend to Wynn to put a thinner blanket in the room in summer so that it can be interchangeable with the very thick blanket that's usually there. But otherwise he thought of absolutely EVERYTHING, including the really nice shower gels and shampoos which were left on our bedside table upon arrival. This is a REALLY FANTASTIC place to stay HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
11003582,100168001,2016-09-07,14025374,Harold,"Excellent location to explore London.  Tube less than 1 minute's walk, Nelson's Column 1 minute the other way. Wynn was a very good host and easy to get on with."

Quite a few restaurants, pubs, cafes, theater shows and shops in this area. Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery, Opera House, Chinatown, Covent Garden are all minutes away. Room is spacious as well, situated in a lovely building. Wynn was welcoming and very responsive. He was available to answer questions but also gave me privacy. Nice little touches in the room to make the stay convenient and comfortable. I had some minor issues connecting with the wifi, but I think it was an issue with my phone. Overall, highly recommend! "

It is indeed spacious, well lit, the entire house is very clean and smelling good. Bed is comfortable with heated sheets available. Towels and toiletries were provided with clean pair of slippers too!! (it feels like home, loved it).  The couch is a bonus, a nice place to relax after a tiring day. Light snacks came in handy during our rush mornings.<br/><br/>Wynn wasn't there when we got there but he gave us clear, simple instructions prior to arriving on how to get inside the building and the room. No problem at all. He responded quickly to our emails when we had a question. The room has ready instructions, maps and all the little details to make our stay convenient. Wynn was also very helpful in providing us information and tips when we needed it.<br/><br/>The location is fantastic. Very very close to Leicester Square station, Trafalgar, London Eye, etc. Lots of good restaurants around the area and few steps away to Chandos. But the room is not noisy at all.<br/><br/>Wonderful, we will definitely stay here again!"

Nonetheless he has been more than welcoming to his own home. He showed me where everything was and such a charmer too. It is very convenient to go around as it is easy to go to the tube or grab a black as it is just in front of St. Martins Lane Hotel, or simply uber it. I would definitely come and stay here again. Without a single doubt! Again thank you so much Wynn, big kiss big hug big love!!!"

Was there to welcome us at the door and showed us the spacious room with toiletries and everything else. I needed it cause one morning my toothbrush fell into the toilet bowl hahaha. Getting in and out of Wynn's apartment was really really easy. And it's a walking distance to many great places, including Piccadilly circus, Oxford Street ans covent garden! There's even a   Tesco just a minute walk away! Don't think about it. Just book and enjoy your stay at Wynn's place!  I will be back next time I'm in London! "
11003582,115267186,2016-11-23,72762210,Alena,"Wynn's place was clean, comfortable and perfectly situated. A short walk from the tube, and just a few minutes from the heart of Leicester Square. Plenty of restaurants surrounding the area, and multiple theatre houses are on the street just over. The room is a bit sheltered from the surrounding bustle and city noise, so while it is in the middle of an active area, the flat itself is quite peaceful.  "

He was very accommodating and went out of his way to make up the couch for me to sleep on, it ended up being really comfortable! We had a bit of trouble getting the second toilet in the half-bathroom to flush so we ended up just using the main bathroom. The location of Wynn's apartment is amazing, especially if you are seeing shows since it is right in the theater district. I like walking so I basically walked everywhere from his place! There is also a lot of cute shopping and many places to eat near his apartment. "

I would recommend this room to a couple catching a show in the Theater district. <br/><br/>Wynn was quick to reply and his instructions clear and easy to follow.

"
11003582,145271086,2017-04-17,75149603,Donna,We really enjoyed our stay at Wynn's place while visiting London. The location was perfect for us. It was within walking distance to many great restaurants and pubs and close to the tube. The place was clean and comfortable. We felt welcome and safe staying at the flat and would definitely stay again!
11003582,145841381,2017-04-20,96365842,Andrew,"Wynn's place is great, centrally located in the heart of Soho. It is surrounded by plenty of amazing shops, restaurants/pubs, as well as being only a couple blocks from Trafalgar Square. Check in/out is also incredibly flexible and easy. I would highly recommend staying with Wynn."
11003582,147132108,2017-04-25,5865814,Lena,"Wynn's apartment was lovely. Great location, very central and easy to get anywhere we wanted via public transit. The apartment was clean and the room was roomy enough for the two of us. Would recommend it!"
11003582,148258308,2017-04-30,125581414,Tanja,"Lovely Airbnb! With a great position, in the heart of London. <br/>Room was very clean with a very comfortable bed! <br/>I really recommend it..."
11003582,149409311,2017-05-04,36665504,Emily,Wynn was a great host and his place was in a great location. I would definitely stay there again. 
11003582,152164167,2017-05-15,95790866,Debby,You won't find a more central location than Wynn's!  Wynn is a generous and friendly host.  We very much enjoyed our stay
11003582,152939473,2017-05-19,24392851,Lars,Great great location. Super forthcomming host. Nice place to be. 
11003582,154154079,2017-05-23,10687430,Lorna,"Absolutely the best location one could have. Basic,but larger than normal room fir London. Quiet and safe. We walked everywhere,theatres,shopping etc.<br/>Better pillows would be a treat."
11003582,155020640,2017-05-27,113904047,Gustavo,"Well located and nicely decorated. Wynn is a really nice guest, he made us feel at home and was very helpful. The only weak point is that our private toilet was tiny. The shower was in the other bathroom, which was shared with Wynn. Cleanliness could improve, but it wasn't bad at all."
11003582,156338311,2017-05-30,4805527,Jenn,Unbelievable location! Very easy directions getting in and out of the unit. Clean and very nice accommodations. Wynn the host was wonderful!
11003582,157216035,2017-06-03,105878511,Jonathan,"I'm almost afraid to say how great this place is for fear it will become too popular. If you are looking for a great place that is in a perfect location, this is it. Pictures don't do it justice. Book it quick before it disappears. "
11003582,158167127,2017-06-05,39460887,Marie-Christine,"Chambre exactement comme sur les photos, donnant sur cour intérieure donc calme. Localisation parfaite pour découvrir une bonne partie de la ville à pieds et en même temps bien située pour les transports en commun. Très bon accueil, Wynn est à l'écoute et donne plein de conseils. A retenir pour un prochain séjour."
11003582,160645723,2017-06-15,11136739,Bob,"Super location.  Walk out the door to great pubs, restaurants,  theaters.   We only used the tubes a few times.  Otherwise we walked as we were close to most of what we wanted to see and do.  Wynn was a gracious host.   If we go back to London,  Wynn's place will be top's on our list of places to stay.<br/>PS.  We arrived 2 days after the attack on London Bridge.   With all the media coverage here in the States, we almost did not go.   I am so glad we did.   Although security is stepped up in London,  people are moving on with there lives.    We felt safe and well received by all.   London is an international City with great atmosphere and tradition.   Its a must see."
11003582,161753117,2017-06-18,78293231,Roderick,"El lugar goza de una excelente ubicación. La habitación tal como sale en las piezas. Todo muy ordenado, limpio, central, conectado a metro, etc. realmente excelente. Si volviera a Londres volvería alojarme donde Wynn."
11003582,162046365,2017-06-19,129697712,Tina,"Wynn's place is definitely the best choice for you to stay in London. Located in central city, it's very near to most scenic spots, China town, Covent garden, west end, the national gallery. You can walk to almost every place. And the bedroom is spacious and clean with everything you need. Wynn is very helpful and allow me to leave my luggage at his place even after checking out time. "
11003582,164058100,2017-06-26,16686026,Andy,"Location, Location, Location!  Wynn's flat was great.  Perfect spot toexplore London.  Wynn was vey communicative and responded to our every need."
11003582,165466588,2017-07-01,90704147,Jessica,"Wynn's place is in an excellent location, does not get much more central right in the heart of London with the metro right around the corner. Wynn's room was big and spacious and even though in the heart of London was very quiet. The only thing we found was that although he did have cereals and fruit there was no milk or bread for breakfast and we found not much opens in London until after 8 (this isn't late by any means but we were jet lagged from our flight and woke up very early). We unfortunately didn't get to meet Wynn however would definitely stay again, you won't be disappointed!! "
11003582,167839778,2017-07-08,17683278,Ricardo,"La ubicacion del flat es excelente.   A corta distancia caminando a Covent Garden, Picadilly Circus,  British Museum, etc.  y cerca de subtes, buses, etc,   Y el vecindario es vibrante y con infinidad de pubs, restaurantes,  y tiendas.    El edificio es antiguo, bonito, tranquilo y limpio.     El dormitorio es tal como se muestra en la fotografia.  La limpieza es aceptable.  El toilet es muy pequeno.  Mi esposa y yo estamos en la mitad de nuestros 60 ""  ,  fue nuestra primera experiencia compartiendo ducha  y no nos sentimos confortables.   Wynn nos dio claras intrucciones y el check in fue sencillo y  siempre respondio nuestros mensajes rapido.  Wynn fue muy amable en permitirnos dejar nuestro equipaje despues del check out time."
11003582,168393087,2017-07-09,92823038,Camille,"La chambre est tout à fait conforme à la photo. L'appartement est au calme et tres central, dans un quartier tres animé. Séjour tres agreable! "
11003582,169736681,2017-07-13,131425781,Shannon,"Absolutely amazing location to explore Liecester Square and Covent Gardens! The host, Wynn, went above and beyond to accommodate us during our stay (it's the little things like bagels/fresh fruit/coffee, fresh flowers in room, great recommendations of places to see/eat, etc.). We will certainly look to stay here again I the future. "
11003582,170941831,2017-07-16,111398421,Sandra,Au coeur des quartiers animés et pourtant très calme pour se poser. Chambre spacieuse et petit déjeuner. Un accueil très agréable de Wynn. 
11003582,172488984,2017-07-21,21325033,Naomi,"Wynn was very accommodating. Everything went smoothly. I would say the two best things about staying here was the fact that although you couldn't beat this location for its vibrant neighbourhood and so close to everything, once you are inside, it is so peaceful. We slept through the night every night for 5 nights and we did so much each and every day. It was a comfortable stay and we'd recommend it. One thing to note if you are picky about privacy (I would consider myself that), there is a shared shower...but it didn't bother me because the hosts were respectful of our space"
11003582,173993099,2017-07-24,93979678,Roya,Df
11003582,176636846,2017-07-31,121007084,Xia,"Wynn is very friendly and helpful. The location is the best for central London, from which you can walk to almost all major attractions."
11003582,177633615,2017-08-03,84944757,Danny,"Would definitely recommend staying here, great value for money and location is great. Wynn is a great host  the room was massive and the apartment lovely. "
11003582,177900709,2017-08-04,133204387,Martin,"Wir haben mit diesem AirBnB wirklich einen Glückstrefffer gelandet, 2 Minuten vom Trafalgar Sqaure entfernt, eine breite Auswahl an Cafés und Restaurants um die Wohnung herum, die U Bahn Haltestelle vielleicht 3 Minuten entfernt. Und Wynn, unser Gastgeber, war sehr gut erreichbar, der Check In hat problemlos funktioniert. Ich war mit meiner kleinen Tochter unterwegs (7 Jahre), wo mir es wichtig war, dass wir eine wirklich gemütliche und friedliche Unterkunft finden, die ein Ort der Erholung ist nach einem geschäftigen Tag in London. Und genau das haben wir dort gefunden. Danke nochmal!"
11003582,179444081,2017-08-07,118229669,Swati,Huge room. Walkable to all tourist attractions and tube station. Wynn is an amazing host. Easy check in and check out. I would definitely recommend his apartment. 
11003582,182736831,2017-08-15,111994340,Danielle,"This is an amazing apartment. Spacious and clean. Wynn is a great host, easy to contact and accommodating with luggage if you are leaving later in the day. Free breakfast in the apartment and walkable to all great tourist sites. Highly recommend you  to stay here."
11003582,185188460,2017-08-21,7434532,Trixi,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay, deliciously quiet although right in the heart of Theatreland. Even if the room is not as huge as the wide-angle pictures make it look, it is *very* spacious by Covent Garden standards and very comfortable.<br/>The flat is spotless, the hosts couldn't be kinder, and Wynn even provides breakfast stuff in the kitchen! We (me and my ten-year-old son) had a wonderful time and will try to come back."
11003582,186582900,2017-08-25,69167492,David,"Although in the heart of central London, a quiet and great place to stay. Super convenient to all sites in central London and very close to the Tube."
11003582,189015900,2017-08-31,10037722,Caroline,"Wynn's place is in the centre of the hustle and bustle of London but was not too noisy. <br/><br/>Wynn was quite thoughtful in that his place has all the bathroom necessities, SIM card (we didn't use this but appreciate the gesture), USB charger, slippers, breakfast with soy milk etc! Breakfast was a huge bonus!!!<br/><br/>Check in also went very smoothly.  Wynn was also nice. The bedroom is as described in pictures.<br/>2 things to consider:<br/>1. As we had to wake up early for tours and flights or were in a rush, you have to be mindful to keep EXTRA quiet as the door does not block out sounds from the hallway or other rooms, which could be a problem for the host who sleeps in the next room. The doors stuff and difficult to open and close quietly.<br/>2. We also appreciated them letting us use the washing machine. However note this was on the host's terms (including timing),  if you prefer to wash and handle your own washing (eg. Handle your own delicates) or need washing to be done asap... this is something to consider. It ended up being okay at the end, as my clothes were clean,  undamaged and ended up drying after hanging it under the fan.<br/><br/>Overall, we enjoyed our stay in London!"
11003582,190896119,2017-09-05,2356926,Narendra,"The place is very centrally located within walking distance to several attractions and a minute away from the tube. There are several nice restaurants, cafes etc all within walking distance. The room is a very decently size although the private toilet is very small. The shower is shared with the hosts."
11003582,192468432,2017-09-10,28026762,Amanda,"Wynn was fantastic! We only met him once when we arrived but anytime we had a question, he was very quick to respond. The apartment was in an absolutely wonderful location. We were less than 10 minutes from the Palace Theatre - where we saw Cursed Child two nights in a row. The area felt very cozy and safe and having the lift was such a relief after long days of walking around the city. I would absolutely stay here again the next time I make it over to London."
11003582,193972052,2017-09-15,16856796,Avonlea,Wynn is the epitome of an exceptional host.  The location could not be more ideal.  Seconds away from the tube and  extremely walkable to eateries and shops.  We had an excellent vacation and a big part of it was staying with Wynn due to how amazing it was!  Don't miss out on staying here.
11003582,195441671,2017-09-19,125353750,Priscilla,"El alojamiento de Wynn tiene una localización inmejorable, no solo es sencillo llegar, sino que el metro te permite desplazarte donde deseas... pero honestamente, todos los sitios de mayor interés están a unos pasos de alcance. El apartamento es encantador, te ofrece todo lo que necesitas. Wynn es una persona cordial, amable, dulce, atenta... un anfitrión espléndido! <br/>Dejo mis recomendaciones y mi agradecimiento en Londres "
11003582,196079747,2017-09-22,49399465,Lindsay,"We stayed in Wynn's room for three nights at the end of a three week tour of the UK.  The room was clean and had plenty of space.  The location is also incredibly central to just about anything.  Wynn is a great communicator and provided us with everything we needed for a great stay.  It was nice to have the private toilet (even though it's very small, as others have noted).  The shower, while shared, was always clean.  Great place to stay in the heart of everything!"
11003582,197927998,2017-09-27,18019806,Kaz,"This fabulous apartment room is so central, so easy! Wynn as host was truly helpful, friendly and informative. Highly recommend this lovely space!! Thanks Wynn!!"
11003582,198122154,2017-09-28,100316353,Sandy,What a fantastic property in such a convenient location! Wynn had thought of everything we might possibly need. Really comfortable and unbelievably quiet considering it's right by Leicester Square! We had a really fantastic time and would definitely stay again. Thank you Wynn.
11003582,199507018,2017-10-02,3675165,Ken,"The location is excellent, in the center of so many exciting venues. The room is large and well stocked, and includes a lift to the 4th floor. Wynn lives there, so is available to assist and answer questions. He responded to my questions by e-mail. All good, and highly recommended."
11003582,200998470,2017-10-07,62841053,Chris,"The location cannot be beat. Within minutes you can be anywhere in central London. Wynn was super friendly and accommodating, always happy to help. We would happily stay there again."
11003582,202462652,2017-10-11,149314228,Luke,Had a fantastic stay. The location is unbeatable. Trafalgar Square is a two minute walk as are the tube stations. The room is very nice and we found it to be quiet at night. Thank you Wynn for being a wonderful host.
11003582,202627592,2017-10-12,536124,Laura,"The location is simply unbeatable, and excellent price/performance too. The room itself is really spacious by Central London standards, and there are plenty of nice little touches making you feel like you are in a decent 4 star hotel (and I mean this as a compliment). We did not meet Wynn in person, but he is always just a message away and quick to respond. He runs a pretty smooth operation there. Please note that to do so there's a webcam installed in the hallway – but the description does say upfront that there is CCTV in common areas."
11003582,203372826,2017-10-15,102917836,Hillary,"We really liked our stay here. It was a great location for us, being so close to theaters, shops and restaurants! The description of the place is spot on and we really appreciate that when renting. The building itself is very nice and quite for the hustle and bustle that is just downstairs. Would recommend!"
11003582,204450823,2017-10-18,79011030,Racquel,"Wynn's apartment is great! It was walking distance to some of the main attractions like Trafalgar Square, The Big Ben and Westminster Abbey, also had some great local dining areas and close to public transport. The apartment itself was just as great, a large bedroom with lounge and the private toilet was a nice bonus. We didn't see much of Wynn because we hadn't adjusted to the change in time zones yet, but when we did he was very lovely and gave us some great tips. Would definitely stay there again!"
11003582,204949582,2017-10-20,91450831,Sophie,"Wynn is a good landlord, he prepared breakfast for me, as well as fresh soy milk, very tasty. He also advised me to keep my luggage in his apartment until I left in the afternoon. I have a happy time in London."
11003582,206903584,2017-10-27,105349541,Jock,"Great place, very friendly host"
11003582,209319412,2017-11-05,4803765,Ken,"This is a great place to stay.  Wynn is friendly and helpful, the room is huge and comfortable, and everything is very clean.  However, the best thing of all is the location - if you love theatre, as I do, almost every theatre in London is within easy walking distance - as well as Covent Garden, the National Gallery, Soho, lots of restaurants, etc.  Next time I come to London, I want to stay here again."
11003582,210264570,2017-11-08,134478401,Philippe,"Large room in a very pleasant apartment.<br/>Warm and comfortable bed, chocolate on the towels, slippers and other little things (like umbrellas and European plugs) that made the stay very comfortable.<br/>We warmly recommend this address."
11003582,210806370,2017-11-11,46364127,Elizabeth,Wynn was a brilliant host. The location is excellent and considering we were slap bang in the middle of London it is a quiet location. We have no hesitation in recommending Wynn and his accommodation.
11003582,211590823,2017-11-13,156906032,Anupam,"I had told my host that I am on a business trip. Small gestures like shoe shine, mending kit were quite nice. Though I couldn't spend much time at the apartment, was really rushed back to back. Loved the Victorian Era apartment structure and design. The room was very well appointed. The host was friendly and helpful."
11003582,212299219,2017-11-17,4586306,Kannan,"Great location, super friendly host, clear and prompt communication and access to kitchen is very helpful. Highly recommend it!"
11003582,213273480,2017-11-20,112079093,Indeg,Good instructions to find the apartment... easy straightforward access into building & a fabulous location. Wynn a lovely unobtrusive host ... a very enjoyable wkend.
11003582,215043403,2017-11-27,69213284,Dandi,"My friend and I had a great time to stay  with my host. The place we is a wonderful and convenient that is super near to the arts museum, such as National Gallery, Portrait Gallery, British Gallery; and Oxford Street, Convert Garden etc. The house is also easy to find tasty restaurant and metro.     I love the house and I love London!!"
11003582,216750758,2017-12-05,21105706,Nina,"I stayed for 8 nights at this Leicester Square flat and so glad that I did. The space was exactly as described. You have access to a large bedroom (especially for this neighborhood) that has a rack with hangers for clothes, a nice couch and coffee table, and TV, large bathroom with shower, and kitchen. Wynn left things out for me for breakfast which included croissants, fruit, jelly, and coffee and tea—a very nice touch. And made it easy to get to my appointments on time.<br/><br/>The real draw of this place is the location. Fantastic neighborhood as a base for tourism or business. Right next to a Starbucks. Stones throw from many great restaurants, pubs, and theatres and a 5 min walk to Leicester Square and metro stop. It’s a straight shot to/from Heathrow from this metro stop on the Piccadilly line.<br/><br/>Check in was very easy. And Wynn was very quick to respond to all messages. He was out of town for most of my stay, and made sure to still check in with me and verify everything is going well.<br/><br/>I would definitely stay again and would recommend to my friends."
11003582,217211552,2017-12-08,22123556,Johnny,"Wynn was a terrific host! His room was very big and he left a lot of personal touches (chocolates on the clean towels, city maps, a tiny sewing kit, etc.) We had a lot of fun in the neighborhood and we couldn't have been happier with Wynn's hospitality.  Thanks Wynn!"
11003582,218881176,2017-12-15,143202924,Shannan,地理位置非常好，周边就是国家美术馆和中国城，离地铁站也非常近。Wynn非常友善，有需要就会提供帮助并且非常及时。房间很干净，甚至细心到准备了苹果手机充电线。厨房有茶，咖啡和点心，房间准备了耳塞和眼罩，考虑的非常周到。在市中心的位置但是很安静，周末也不吵，不管是旅游还是商务差旅都十分推荐常住！
11003582,219072046,2017-12-16,91466939,James,Absolutely terrific location and great room. Great communication and very nice host. You won't be disappointed thats for sure. Would book again

11003582,226193890,2018-01-09,134032706,Mujahid,Wynn's place is in possibly the best location for someone wanting to get to know London. The heated bed is a great perk too!
11003582,227829123,2018-01-16,164221982,Shipeng,It’s really a nice flat. Nice location and Wynn is definitely a nice landlord.
11003582,228344510,2018-01-19,46942689,Anne-Marie,Wynn was a fantastic host.  The location was superb.  We were able to walk to wherever we wanted to go.  The room was spotless and the apartment building is very secure and nice and quiet.  Would definitely stay here again.

11003582,233401220,2018-02-09,2500541,Carolina,"Para começar, Wynn é um doce de pessoa. Só de conhecer ele já foi muito legal. <br/>A localização do flat é a melhor de Londres, na minha opinião. Da para fazer quase tudo a pé, ou por transportes, é tudo muito perto. <br/>O quarto é limpo, espaçoso, organizado e descolado. <br/>Virei fã, e assim que voltar a Londres espero conseguir ficar aí de novo! Beijos Wynn e muito obrigada"
11003582,234330953,2018-02-12,14863284,Masha,Lovely space in a great neighborhood! Seconds away from tons of theatres and restaurants and also very convenient to get to/from Heathrow Airport. Wynn was very welcoming and had clear instructions. The room is really very peaceful for such a bustling spot.  We had a great time!
11003582,236063861,2018-02-18,33977393,Garrett,"The location here was fantastic, very close to Leicester Square and a block away from Leicester Station, but I would not stay at this AirBnB again. As soon as you walk in there is a camera in the hallway. Although this was given in the description, it just makes the AirBnb feel very unwelcoming and it made us feel like we weren't trusted. It made my partner and I feel uneasy the entire time. Also, the bathroom has no heating so there is a small heater that is used. The host was too persistent on reminding us to turn it off to the point where we felt unwelcome in the home. After all, my partner rented this place out for a week and spent almost $1,000 USD on this reservation. With that in mind the host being so persistent on using the heater was overkill. All of the cabinets were labeled ""Private"" which was not an issue, but when we ran out of toilet paper, the paper was in a ""Private"" cabinet so we were not sure if we were even allowed to open it and get toilet paper out. The first night there the host also touched our toiletries and moved them around the bathroom because he didn't like where we had placed them. The provided ""breakfast"" was also very minimal. There was a loaf of bread and some bagels in a bag, but besides that no variety of food was offered to us. There was cereal, but no milk. It seemed like other reviews mentioned croissants and more variety, but the breakfast offered to us seemed pretty minimal and low-effort. Overall I felt that the host was not prepared for our visit. Between the camera, moving our things, and generally feeling like our every move might spark a comment it was hard to really feel relaxed and enjoy our stay here."

11003582,244976421,2018-03-20,49935028,Helen,"We had a really pleasant stay at Wynn's place. The location was central and very convenient to the places we wanted to go, just 2-3 minutes' walk to the tube station. The size of the room is big considering it's in central London, yet it's very quiet as it faces the court yard. The host Wynn is patient and acts quickly to responses. We really enjoyed our stay."

11003582,258021314,2018-04-28,17337683,Rohini,"This was our first time in London, and the location of this place is amazing. Very well connected to Underground lines, bus lines, restaurants, bars (Starbucks is literally next door!) That being said, the apartment does not face the road (faces in toward the rest of the parts of the building - if that makes sense) so it is very quiet and peaceful. <br/>Check in was smooth, you get a set of keys to keep for the duration of your stay. Wynn let us keep our bags in the common space after we checked out till the end of that day. We picked them up and dropped the keys off on our way out. <br/>Room itself is quite spacious and you get a private toilet. There is a separate bathroom (that is shared) with a shower + tub. <br/>Breakfast included tea, coffee, milk, cereal, fruit, bread/toast, choc chip brioche rolls, nut butters, jam.<br/>Wynn was very courteous and responsive. Will definitely stay here again!"

The room was very clean and had everything we needed - it was nice to be able to relax and watch TV or Netflix at night. The room was bigger than many of the hotel rooms available in the city for a similar price. "
11003582,274992828,2018-06-10,123007089,Kristina,Wynns place is perfect for a weekend getaway and very central to everything you need to see in London.

The flat was lovely and clean and looks like the photos online (allowing for perspective). There was a bottle of cava, a lollipop and several small toiletries provided. I really enjoyed my stay there."
11003582,357714908,2018-12-11,45076419,Alessandra,"Le due cose migliori di questa esperienza da Wynn sono state sicuramente la posizione della stanza (a 1 minuto a piedi da Trafalgar Square e Leicester Square) e la disponibilità di Wynn a rispondere velocemente alle nostre richieste! Inoltre in camera abbiamo trovato piccole cose che ci hanno fatto sentire da subito accolti, asciugamani, kit dentifricio spazzolino, bagnoschiuma e shampoo e il letto riscaldabile è stata una vera chicca dopo giornate intere al freddo per girare la città. Consigliato assolutamente!"

Brilliant location and lovely host. <br/><br/>I had my 4 month old daughter with me and unfortunately getting a pram in and out of the building was a huge hassle (narrow door and steps - pram had to be collapsed and baby carried in arms, it was a real struggle for me).  I wouldn’t stay again with a pram, but would absolutely recommend to all other travellers, sensational airbnb room!"
11003582,369114982,2019-01-09,45890281,Charley,Wynn's place is in the perfect location. He is very helpful and the breakfast available was very handy.<br/>I would highly recommend his apartment if you are thinking of coming to london

11003582,402707275,2019-01-19,236118851,Ariane,"Très déçue! Bien que l’appartement soit très central, propre et les photos conformes, le matelas est en très mauvais état : très mou, enfoncé dans le sommier et on sent les ressorts à chaque mouvement. J’ai donc dû quitter le logement après une seule nuit passée là bas et trouver un hôtel dans l’urgence. Wynn nous a proposé de prendre le matelas gonflable qui se trouvait dans l’armoire à la place. Cette solution tentée pour une nuit ne pouvait évidemment pas convenir pour un séjour longue durée. Lui qui avait été si réactif dans ses messages jusqu’à notre arrivée n’a pas pris en compte notre désarroi, alors que le confort du lit était ma première question avant de réserver. Je n’y reviendrai pas."

Also very flexible and want to help with everything. However, in the description of the room I got the impression that we have a privet bathroom. So I think that it is better to clarify that only the toilet is privet but the bath not. <br/>I surely recommend it for people that do not mind to share bathroom because all the rest is amazing :)"

11003582,425441498,2019-03-18,64933230,Paige,Wynn’s home was such a great place to stay! Check in was very easy and Wynn was provided very clear instructions. The location was better than I could’ve asked for- it was close to so many popular places for travelers. Wynn was great at communicating and making sure we were comfortable and taken care of.

We traveled mostly by bus in central London, enjoying the scenery that past us by. We were very satisfied with our stay."

Thank you for the last minute acceptance of our reservation and your warm welcoming!!! Thank you!!
11003582,464710734,2019-06-06,120783721,Taís,This was by far one of the best places I've ever stayed. The apartment is located in THE BEST LOCATION OF LONDON - close to most tourist attractions and close to the subway. The house is extremely clean and comfortable. Wynn was super kind. Don't hesitate to stay here!
11003582,468832881,2019-06-13,7472273,Tanya,"Wynn's room was really big and spacious, something pretty unheard of in the heart of London- which we loved! Great for travelers who have big/ more than 1 suitcase and need to open them up every day. The bathrooms were also well kept and clean, and the kitchen was very welcoming. There was coffee and tea available for us every morning, and even mini packs of cereal and bread and crumpets (and spreads!) if we wanted. Wynn actually wasn't in the house during our stay (he himself was overseas) so we had the whole house to ourselves which was nice, although he also made sure we were taken care of and replied to our messages promptly. <br/><br/>PS. We loved the super cute flamingo decor pieces around the house! (:"
11003582,469312734,2019-06-14,12066283,Anh,"The place is lovely with lots of Pink Flamingos, not to mention the most central location in London where downtown London is at your doorsteps. From there you can literally walk to all the attractions and restaurants. The room is of decent size with comfortable bed<br/>The host provides guests with abundant of snacks and stuff for breakfast.<br/>Wynn is also super responsive and helpful in many ways. More reason to love London with such a wonderful stay!"
11003582,472676425,2019-06-20,38494016,Jennifer,"Wynn is a fantastic host and his space is absolutely great and we would highly recommend it if it’s available during your time in London. <br/><br/>Not only is the location ultra convenient (it is right in the heart of theatre district and super close to the underground), but the space and amenities are really nice. <br/>The bed was very comfortable and there was a nice sitting area in the room - so it was a great spot to retreat to after walking our feet off around Camden Market and the British Museum. <br/><br/>Wynn is a very thoughtful host and there were many nice touches like providing us with a toiletry kit, bagels and tea for breakfast, and letting us leave our baggage at the apartment while sightseeing. Thank you Wynn!"
11003582,474415918,2019-06-23,32968380,Ling Er,"Wynn is a very friendly, accommodating and helpful host. Days before we arrive at his apartment, he contacted me to confirm my visit and check-in time. As my friend and i took a late flight to London, our check-in time was at 10.30 p.m. and Wynn ensured that our check-in was a breeze. All we did was to give him a ring and he let us into the building remotely. Despite being away visiting his parents, he was prompt in rendering help via the Airbnb messaging function. One stance: When we asked about purchasing of tickets for musicals, Wynn immediately sent a link to download an app for purchasing of musical tickets (he was already on his way to the airport). <br/><br/>His house is very clean and organized. Ooh... I must mention that the house smelt excellent. Everything in the house is clearly labelled and there are instructions which are clear to understand and follow. Love the privacy that Wynn gave us. Light breakfast was provided and there was filtered water in the kitchen.<br/><br/>Location of the house is excellent! There are several stations near the Airbnb. The closest station is less than 5 min walk from  The furthest was less than 10 min walk from the apartment. Throughout our stay in London, my friend and I either walked or took the underground/rail. <br/>There was no need to uber or take a  cab which would cost a bomb. The apartment is surrounded by theatres. My friend and I watched musicals every evenings.<br/><br/>Shopping was great too. We walked to oxford street and shopped. Then we would walk back to the apartment to put down our purchases  before we walked back to oxford street to continue with our shopping. Covent Garden is within walking distance too.<br/><br/>There are eateries surrounding apartment no worries going hungry.<br/><br/>For travelers with large luggage, you need to be mindful that the lift is small.  One can easily overcome this by moving the luggage one at a time.<br/><br/>All in all, Wynn is an awesome host and his apartment is perfect."
11003582,479770059,2019-07-01,40551991,Irada,He ia really good and helpful. The room was clean and located in good location. I recommend to stay in this place if you want a room locate in heart of london!
11003582,484708822,2019-07-09,126327332,Edgar,"Ideal location in attractive vintage apartment building with good elevator.  Huge well-curtained window lets in plenty of indirect light and air; yet the sounds of the city fail to penetrate, day or night, even when the window is flung wide.  Host is helpful, thoughtful, and discreet,  and usually out of sight and hearing in an apt.-within-apt.   Private toilet with mini-sink (in deep, repurposed closet?)  convenient and effective.   All I shared with the two residents was a shower.   I rose early and they rose later; no problem.  It is not as convenient as having one's own en suite bathroom, but it worked, as it works to share a friend's only shower when visiting.   Home clean and in order.  Host did an evening  load of laundry for me in an apt.-style washer that leaves clothes damp.  As he promised, the clothes dried completely overnight on a rack.   Good options for easy meals and theatre of the first rank, steps away from the front door.  I liked breakfast and lunch at La Roche,  a cafe simpler than its name."
11003582,490337309,2019-07-18,32392587,Karen,"location was simply great as you could basically walk to many places like Covent Garden and Chinatown under 15 minutes! the Leicester Square (Piccadilly Line) tube station was just an easy 3 minute walk away as well, really really convenient. the line also brings you directly to Heathrow Airport without having to change trains at all! <br/><br/>the room was really spacious and it was nice to have a clothes rack with hangers as well as a sofa for us to chill out. <br/><br/>Wynn was a friendly and accommodating host who allowed us to leave our luggage at his place after check-out since our flight back home was later at night! don’t hesitate anymore to stay here, you won’t regret it :)"

The flat and building is clean and well-maintained, very quiet, and only a two minute walk to Leicester Square station. Highly recommend!"
11003582,524169641,2019-09-05,5324234,Li San,"Amazing location close to everything. Room was comfy, clean and cosy. Check-in and check-out very easy. Nice selection left out for us for breakfast. Wynn wasn't there himself but made sure everything was fine. Very handy to have a private toilet. We couldn't leave our bag after checking out because the apartment was booked for the next day, but I'm sure Wynn would have let us otherwise. If you're heavily pregnant and a side sleeper (specific, I know) you might find the mattress too hard, but I managed with all the extra pillows available! Overall a great stay!"

Wynn was helpful without being too much advising, and we didn’t see him for long but he was highly available on mobile contact in case of any help needed. <br/>I was afraid of the shared bathroom but finally it wasn’t a problem and the fact that we had private toilets made the difference. <br/>For my first Air BnB : Perfect Experience. <br/>Hope to come back once."

The only problem with the place was that the toilet happened to be outside of the room and the shower had to be shared. Some travelers might be okay with that though. Just wanted to put it out there since it wasn't very clear for me when I was booking the place."
11003582,566743688,2019-11-20,183154850,Anthony,"The accommodation is exactly as all the great reviews suggest. Very nice bedroom in flat with private water closet (toilet) and immaculate shared bathroom with host. The room itself is a good size with high ceilings and large window. Very quiet. Lovely heritage building with good elevator. Common kitchen very modern with all the amenities and lots of self made breakfast options available including fruit. The location is 10 out of 10 with Trafalgar Square, West End Theatre district, Covent Garden and many other points of interest right there. Host is fantastic and very helpful. Very good value in London."

De ligging is echter fantastisch en maakt veel goed. <br/>Het bed ligt uitstekend. Er is geen enkel lawaai van buiten.<br/><br/>Wynn is gastvrij en comunicatief. Inchecken en uitchecken was zeer flexibel en verliep probleemloos. <br/><br/>Om drie dagen Londen verkennen, is de airbnb zeer goed"

11003582,705043941,2020-10-30,174983869,Domenyk,"My first impression of the room was that it wasn't quite as bright and big as it seemed in the photos , but to be fair,  that was good advertising photography.  The room is as advertised,  it is very clean and despite being an older building,  the use of modern lighting makes it nice and bright. You get open wardrobes, toiletries and towels and there is basic breakfast available for free.  Wifi is fast as well. Only downsides are no view and no parking. Bathroom is bright and funky.<br/><br/>The main reasons to stay here and why it rates so highly are;<br/>1) Location . Its all right there.  Covent Garden, Buckingham Palace,  London Eye and the South Bank,  Leicester Square,  Trafalgar Square and every tube line.  Easy walking distance.<br/><br/>2) Price. For that location,  you probably won't find cheaper. Plus you aren't sacrificing quality. Yeah it's not a luxury apartment, but if you want that you have to pay the price. Its bright,  clean and everything that can be done to give it a quality feel has been done.<br/><br/>3) Easy. Wynn would get back to me within 5 minutes of the few questions I had.  I asked for an afternoon checkout,  and again,  had an answer 5 minutes later and it was no problem. He could just sell the room on its location and price,  but he really makes the effort to do the hospitality side. Frankly if you want to stay right in the heart of London for this price range, you would be a fool to stay anywhere else."

The accommodation is accessed by a lift or stairs, and all shared access areas are well serviced and clean. The room is large and very clean, with a comfortable bed, internet tv, and private w.c. The bathroom is shared with the hosts, but was very clean and never a problem. A vegan breakfast was supplied, which included teas, coffee, muesli, soya milk, bananas,  bagels, and muffins.

Ross's flat was sparkling clean and recently redecorated throughout. Ross provided fresh bed linen, towels and the bedroom was spacious.  I really appreciate Ross's hospitality. He provided me with breakfast and lots of fresh fruit. Many thanks Ross, it was great to meet you."
11766029,83664245,2016-07-03,57891915,Susy,"Many thanks to Vicki for making our stay so pleasant. We stayed for 4 nights over the Wimbledon tennis fortnight. The house location is great for the tennis - a pleasant walk home after watching tennis. The house description was accurate and the accommodation was very comfortable , clean and very well prepared for visitors - even with helpful house guide for all facilities we may need during our stay. Vicki always responded very quickly and was extremely helpful - also sorting out visitor parking permits for our stay. <br/>All together - a lovely base for the tennis and a very helpful and responsive host. Thanks!!"
11766029,84559837,2016-07-08,60618836,Gary,Vicki was a superb host and her lovely home was the perfect place for us to stay! Everything was just as she described and we could not have asked for a more wonderful experience. I only wish we could have stayed longer!<br/><br/>We look forward to staying again next year!
11766029,169589266,2017-07-13,31322526,Christopher,This was a great location for Wimbledon tennis and the lively Wimbledon high street. The house was lovely and the garden was very restful. Super for a family of four (we were 2 adults and 2 teenagers). We enjoyed the Wimbledon welcome food and drink left for us by Vicki. 
11766029,471853475,2019-06-18,99384717,Jon,Excellent townhome in a quiet area of Wimbledon. Incredibly clean and comfortable. Very stylish. Excellent response from owners if anything is needed. Very easy to walk around Wimbledon or take a quick tube into London.  All the amenities that you need with grocery stores and nice restaurants just a short walk a way. Perfect for my family’s vacation.
11766029,480652936,2019-07-03,10658590,Lars,We loved our stay at Vicki s House in Wimbledon. The House is really clean and you have all the amenities you need in perfect conditions.The bedrooms are big and clean and you have a bathroom on all floors.

11938782,161591895,2017-06-18,104016037,Marta Maria,"Julia house was lovely and confortable: The kitchen was fully furnished, the room was very tidy and the bathroom too. Thank you for everything, I really had great time!"
11938782,167657564,2017-07-07,136347115,Priska,Julia's apartment is very nice and the room is very clean. The communication was perfect and I got to meet Julia on my last day. She is a very lovely person and her housemate also made me feel home during my stay. The place is near public transport and there are many restaurants around. Definitely recommend a stay at Julia's apartment. 
11938782,177016072,2017-08-01,39214487,Camille,Les photos sont tout à fait conformes à la réalité! Les colocataires de Julia sont très gentils et accueillants. Le quartier est agréable et facilement accessible en bus (au pied de l'appartement). Julia fait tout pour que le séjour se passe bien.  Je recommande!

12087145,76662986,2016-05-28,977163,Mark,A very clean and spacious flat in a great location. Very easy to check-in and to leave. Rabih was very accommodating of all of our requests and suggestions. I would definitely recommend staying here.
12087145,77262519,2016-05-31,956048,Diane,This was our first Airbnb experience and after negotiating the somewhat confusing website our stay went like clockwork thanks to Rabih. We were able to arrange an early check in to leave our bags at the flat before heading to the west end. Being so close to Fulham Broadway station was certainly very handy and the various restaurants and cafes just around the corner were great. <br/>The 4 of us had more than enough room inside which was more than adequately furnished and the garden was a real bonus. I would definitely recommend staying here. 
12087145,80185058,2016-06-16,69023491,Anil,Had great time was good comfortable and good apartment <br/> Only attached bath is too tiny <br/> Over all good experience 
12087145,80916196,2016-06-20,3472685,Angela,Rabih and his wife were very friendly hosts who were also very flexible. We were able to have an early check-in and leave the bags in the appartments until the new guests arrived. That was great. Also the appartment is in a very convenient location only 2 minutes from Fulham Brodway station away. <br/>The appartment was clean and well kept. Especially the two bathrooms are very convenient if you are travelling with other people. Only the room to the road is a bit noisy at night and in the early morning. 
12087145,82137703,2016-06-26,39009539,Caroline,Rabih was very welcoming and helpful and met us early so we could leave our bags in the flat while we went out for the day.  Everything was very easy.
12087145,84522705,2016-07-07,3614181,George,"Great location, only minutes from Fulham Broadway to get further into town yet also a great selection of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Having the park around the corner as well as the back garden was a real bonus. Rabih was very helpful, we would definitely stay there again."
12087145,85079503,2016-07-10,71474097,Camilla,"Foi tudo bem. A Jules nos recebeu antes da hora do check in, com muita simpatia. O apto é muito perto da estação do metrô. Rabih nos permitiu ficar até depois da hora do check out, foi muito simpático e prestativo."
12087145,90029007,2016-07-30,11833814,Marta,"L'appartamento di Rabih corrisponde precisamente a come descritto. Ci siamo trovate decisamente bene, il proprietario è molto accogliente e sempre disponibile! La casa è ben collegata al centro della città, essendo a pochi passi dalla stazione metro ed esattamente davanti la fermata degli autobus. Ristoranti, bar e supermercati molto vicini!<br/>"
12087145,90699833,2016-08-01,15212848,Susan,"My husband and our 2 children had a wonderful stay here. The flat is literally less than 1 min walk to Fulham Broadway (Tube, Waitrose, Cinema, Restaurants) & 1 min walk to Eel Brook Common with its lovely playground. The flat was clean and very well equipped with the extra bonus of a small garden where we ate outside. Netflix was also a very welcome bonus. Rabih was a lovely host, very quick to respond and welcoming. Highly recommend."
12087145,92306478,2016-08-08,75755185,Cesar,Perfect location and everything worked fine.<br/>Hosts very polite and friendly<br/>We do recommend the apart and the hosts
12087145,95053773,2016-08-18,80140149,Arlene,"Rabih was quick to respond to our queries and was very kind and helpful. He sent us extra info about how to get a minicab and how to look for theatre tickets. He phoned us when our plane was late and met us quickly upon our arrival, even though it was later than planned. The neighborhood is very convenient, with bus stops right out front and the Fulham Broadway tube station about 2 blocks away. You can be at Westminster Abbey or other tourist attractions in about a half hour. There is a lot of traffic on the street. Grocery stores, pubs, fast food, and restaurants are all within a few blocks. A football stadium is nearby, too."
12087145,96203324,2016-08-22,4018515,David,"The garden would need to be done with outdoor furniture, lighting and so on. The TV cable needs sorted out. A dishwasher needed also"
12087145,98303804,2016-08-30,53188194,Tom,Lovely
12087145,100254561,2016-09-08,64322251,Pratibha,Rabih was extremely helpfull in ensuring we checked in early as our flight arrived earlier than the scheduled checkout time. <br/>The appartment is located a min away from the tube . There is a bus stop right outside the house. <br/>Rabih has been a gracious and helpfull host. <br/>I would recommend this apartment to all. 
12087145,100828707,2016-09-11,65053433,Jan,We had a wonderful stay.
12087145,104400451,2016-09-26,27562321,Renee,"Rabih's apartment was very comfortable for our family of three and in an excellent location for exploring central London. The two bedrooms were ample in size and could easily accommodate two couples or a family with two children. The kitchen was well stocked and we made a few simple meals. The dining table comfortably sat three but could fit four. We enjoyed the area of Fulham tremendously as there were numerous transportation options, shops, and restaurants. We would definitely choose this apartment again if traveling to London."
12087145,105334590,2016-10-01,48300557,Ryan,Beautiful apartment centrally located in Chelsea/Fulham area. Very close to the tube stop. Lots of restaurants and supermarkets nearby including a Whole Foods. Rabih and his wife were very accommodating in meeting with us early when we arrived before the normal afternoon check in.  I recommend for any family.
12087145,106851687,2016-10-08,8963684,Lisa,Our family spent a lovely week at Rabih's place in London. It was a perfect place to easily explore this wonderful city. The tube is minutes away and the number 11 bus stops right outside the home which was lots of fun to catch into town as it passed many lovely towns. <br/>Rabih is an excellent host who went out of his way to make our stay comfortable. The home has been recently renovated giving it lots of modern comforts but still keeping the charm of a London terrace. We would highly recommend anyone stay here and if we are ever back in London we will definitely come and stay again. <br/>Lisa 
12087145,109564172,2016-10-22,52968316,Jonathan,"Fantastic place and host, highly recommended it! It was nicer than the pictures depicted, more spacious than expected. Very clean and tidy. Quite neighborhood. 3 blocks from tube stop and everything you could want. Host was warm, welcoming, and very responsive in communication. "
12087145,112145074,2016-11-04,101109273,Helen,"Location is AMAZING! The 11 bus (which does pretty much the same route as the open top tourist buses) stops right outside the apartment.  It's also the first stop so you're guaranteed front row seats!! Only a very short walk to the tube too.  Lots of local restaurants and bars.  <br/>Apartment is really lovely, kitted out with everything you'll need including most toiletries and basic supplies (tea, coffee, etc.).<br/>Finally our hosts, Rabih and Joelle, were very friendly and communicative.  All in all a fab few days in London.  Thank you very much."
12087145,112736695,2016-11-07,101404492,Graeme,"Excellent, convenient location. Flat is comfortable, modern and is ideal for a weekend trip. Rabih was very helpful and responded to everything immediately."
12087145,113372969,2016-11-12,830819,Serena,"Bellissima esperienza! La casa è molto spaziosa, pulita e davvero ben tenuta e con tutte le comodità  (anche macchina x espresso"
12087145,116299884,2016-11-29,4942146,N,"Great place to stay; clean, great location, reasonably priced."
12087145,120583632,2016-12-11,98862888,Marco,"Rabih is a great host. He took the time to explain how the amenities in his flat work and if I needed anything to just let him know. The Nestcafe coffee maker and Netflix were a nice a touch. Very welcoming and homey flat. There's a whole food market, restaurants (Chinese, Italian, and subway) and pubs within walking distance. The metro station is about a 5 minute walk. "
12087145,121634517,2016-12-18,74578188,Andy,"Great stay, for my wife and two children on our Xmas weekend. Location is perfect for bobbing around London, with only a short 2 min walk to Fulham tube station, Fulham and neighbouring Chelsea within easy walking distances. The ground floor garden flat is well presented, clean and has enough room for 4 people to spend a good few days. Rabih, while out of country was really helpful and communication was answer almost immediately. Fully enjoyed and well recommended, thank you "
12087145,122241843,2016-12-22,62158223,Sean,"Very clean and well-maintained, modern apartment; attentive hosts. Pictures are accurate. Netflix was a nice bonus. The place is a very short walk to a Tube station (Fulham Broadway)."
12087145,123455704,2016-12-29,15094993,Robin,great (fantastic) location. Wholefoods and Underground within 200 yards. clean and modern space. cool garden area. attentive host.
12087145,124619907,2017-01-02,4906895,Benedetta,"The flat was fully equipped, clean and very comfortable. I recommend this place. Very friendly and helpful owners. "
12087145,145038967,2017-04-17,8571417,Vera,"The apartment is very clean and very nice. The locariam is fantastic. Plenty of restaurants, Food marketing and the metro station is 2min walking."
12087145,146927448,2017-04-24,60063106,David,Spotlessly clean flat 2 minutes from Fulham Broadway tube and close Eelbrook Common park.
12087145,149046595,2017-05-02,4957199,Shiyun,位置好，离地铁近；房屋整洁，面积不大但配置齐全，周边环境好。西区是个好地方。
12087145,150752248,2017-05-09,45014573,Rui,"Rabih's place is very close to Fulham's tube station, we couted with a lot of flexibility on check in and checkout hours. A very good solution for who is thinking about a sightseeing trip to London. Totally recommended.<br/>"
12087145,153162986,2017-05-20,2599129,J.,"A great flat in Fulham, tube stops across the street, Sainsbury's in the tube station and Whole Foods a few minutes walk away. Easy tube connections to the rest of the city, Netflix for binging. Perfect place in all respects."
12087145,154777841,2017-05-26,117972967,Lynne,I would highly recommend this apartment. The location was really handy right near the tube and Fulham has a good lot of restaurants near by. The apartment was relatively spacious for London. It was very comfortable for 4 people and having two bathrooms was a real bonus. The background was great to be able to step out into the fresh air or have a drink.
12087145,164079113,2017-06-26,89833289,Jeffrey,"The owner is fantastic. He was very responsive when we had a question, and he took care of any maintenance issues that we encountered. The location is also great, and the flat was very quiet despite the bustling neighborhood around us. "
12087145,169576444,2017-07-13,72775921,Christina,"The best part about this flat is the fantastic location.  Whole Foods, the tube, shops, restaurants and coffee shops are all literally right out the door.  We enjoyed the ample space, and the flat was pretty quiet, despite being on a busy road.  Rabih and Nicole were quite good about communication which we appreciated. <br/><br/>Our biggest issues were the fact that one of the bathrooms was not working upon arrival.  The toilet would not flush at all, and came very close to overflowing several times.  Although there was a second bathroom, we used that one to put a pack and play for our daughter to nap during the day (she needed it very dark in order to sleep bc of the time difference).  Anyway, to make a long story short, my husband was instructed by Rabih to go out and buy a plunger, and that we would be reimbursed. We bought the plunger, and it solved the issue but we were not reimbursed.    We found this unacceptable, considering they asked us to let workers in (which we thought was a lot to ask of us) so that the upstairs neighbors could install windows--but we were going to be gone that day for my brothers wedding.  So, Rabih had to make arrangements for someone else to come to the flat to let them in.  Someone came by, but never reimbursed us for the plunger. The second issue was the fact the floors were filthy.  It has to have been months since they were properly mopped.  At an initial glance, they ""look"" ok, but we literally had to wash our infant daughters feet and legs every time we left the unit because they were black from the filth and dirt on the floor.  Lastly, a huge reason we rented this particular flat was for the outside space for our kids to play.  Upon our arrival, there was a huge piece of downed tree taking up most of the garden, and half the brick wall was also missing. This made the yard unusable for our kids.  After my husband contacted Rabih about the yard, he did make arrangements for it to be cleaned up, which we did appreciate, but it was frustrating for us to have to rearrange our day to stay home for the workers to be there.  And even once the debris was cleaned up, the yard was completely opened to the neighbors and not a secure space as we had initially thought when looking at the listing.<br/><br/>All and all, with some improvements I would recommend this flat, or if you are willing to possibly deal with some inconveniences in order to be in a great location."
12087145,172486112,2017-07-21,22021667,Jane,This is a fabulous family apartment where thought has gone into making your stay as comfortable as possible. Outside area a bonus. Would highly recommend.
12087145,174170723,2017-07-25,55846755,Gloria,Rabih is a caring and great host. Even though we couldn't meet up he remained contactable via SMS and was prompt in replying my queries. We enjoyed our short stay in London. Appreciate it :)
12087145,177515938,2017-08-03,23167010,Robyn,"This apartment was in a great location, close to the tube, supermarkets, restaurants and within walking distance of parks & nice cafes. Had a problem with the oven, it wouldn't heat up. Had everything we needed and was well equipped. Had a problem with the second bedroom shower, water wouldn't drain away. Rabih was easy to contact & very willing to accommodate us with check in problems."
12087145,192715465,2017-09-11,55928161,Marylene,Très bel appartement confortable et bien situé à proximité des commerces et du métro. Il y a un peu de bruit à cause de la circulation de la  rue.<br/>Nous recommandons cet appartement.
12087145,196730322,2017-09-24,108948803,Kate,"Our family of four had a great stay at Rabih's place. It was a perfect size for us, giving a good mix of space with young kids and family time as well. Very handy to have a kitchen to help save money with making lunches and dinners as well.<br/><br/>The flat is in a great location, very close to the tube, convenient buses and 10 minutes into the heart of London. Lots of restaurants, pubs and supermarkets close by, as well as a nice park and playground. <br/><br/>My only comment for families with young kids is that it is on a noisy main road and also that the fence in the backyard has fallen down, meaning that younger kids would need to be supervised in the yard. Otherwise, an excellent place to stay and Rabih is a helpful host! I would definitely recommend this flat."
12087145,201780494,2017-10-09,85228159,So-Yeun,좋은 위치와 정원이 만족스러운 곳입니다. 사진과 똑같아요. 화장실 하나는 샤워가 안되는거랑 후라이팬이 낡은건 좀 아쉬웠어요. 아래층이라 티비가 잘 안나오긴 합니다. 조용해요. 체크인때 숙소로 가니 호스트가 계셔서 설명해줬습니다. 당일에 전화해서 입실했어요.

They made my family feel so welcome and the location of the flat was outstanding for us.  We had a small issue with the bath tub and our hosts responded immediately and tried to resolve the issue as soon as possible even though we were already checking out the next day.  Attentive hosts, beautiful flat and great location. Thank you Rabih and Joelle!  "

12140520,71663813,2016-04-27,66768217,Alexander,"Staying at Sebastian's is plain awesome. He made me feel welcome and at home as soon as I walked in through the front door. I was met by generosity, plenty of good advice and humour, and great housing standards. Besides being an impeccable host, Sebastian is also great and warm person.<br/><br/>The apartment is modern and spacious, having all the stuff you'd need. The location is very good – you'll be in the smack center of London in pretty much no time.<br/><br/>All in all a great stay!"
12140520,71770046,2016-04-28,17417320,Jason,I super place to stay. Highly recommend. Sebastian made me feel very welcome. The flat is clean and tidy. Great location 2 mins from old street station. I had my own entry door and shared bathroom. All in all...perfect!

12140520,73933842,2016-05-11,14932002,Daniel,"Great location and a fabulous, accommodating host -- in short, it was wonderful time at Sebastian's. The other reviewers have said it as well, but it's worth repeating: Sebastian is generous, knowledgable, helpful and will go out of his way to assist you however he can.<br/><br/>Had a great time chatting over drinks -- several times during the stay! Wish that there had been more downtime to chat even longer. Next time!<br/><br/>The listing is clean, comfortable and functional. It is located just steps from Old Street Station, and yet feels quiet and secluded and comes with your own entrance. "
12140520,74536609,2016-05-15,906083,Jack,Sebastian was very attentive and helpful. If I needed anything he was accommodating. 
12140520,74886237,2016-05-17,8688501,Bernhard,Another superb stay with my most favourite host on AirBnB! Everything was expected and I'm very much looking forward to my next stay in London at Sebastian's place
12140520,75195957,2016-05-19,10117391,Eugenia,"Sebastian has been a very kind host and I had very good interactions with him. The room is comfortable and very clean, and the private entrance is practical. <br/><br/>The room is located on a separate floor, with another room, which is also rented, and the bathroom. There is no lock on the room door.<br/><br/>The bathroom is also shared with the other room and, although decent, could have been cleaner. <br/><br/>Overall, I have had a good stay."
12140520,75672045,2016-05-22,68665197,Michiel,"This was my first airbnb experience, so I had no high expectations really. Somehow the host got me mixed up with an other airbnb guest, who was on the same floor, and missed out on me on my arrival. That's why I could not leave my bag for the day as agreed on. The host apilogised for that. I did not let that affect my London visit though. The location and the room were good enough for me.<br/>"
12140520,76434288,2016-05-27,467055,Jennifer,"Sebastian is a welcoming, helpful host who ensured my arrival and departure went smoothly. His flat is lovely and in a great location. My room was very comfortable and the separate entrance provides independence. Recommended."
12140520,77747211,2016-06-03,1872893,Sasha,"Excellent choice if you need a central spot in London to come home to, would highly recommend & absolutely stay again!  Sebastian was terrific, one of the best hosts I've met: very welcoming & communicative but unobtrusive.  I wish I'd been around more to get to know him, but I mostly just came home to sleep.<br/><br/>The apartment is great: has just what you need, very clean, with a good bathroom in particular.  Fast internet in description is no joke (room also has tons of outlets)!  Transportation really couldn't be more convenient, as described in the listing.<br/><br/>The separate entrance gives you autonomy; it truly feels like a separate apartment as it/the bathroom are on their own floor, separated from all else by a door that leads to a staircase into the rest of the apartment.  Really, the only downside was the upstairs tenant's footsteps could occasionally be heard (maybe in heels?), but only during the day and not in a way that really impacted sleep.<br/><br/>Overall very accurate listing, I found it even nicer in person."
12140520,78019980,2016-06-05,29426931,Jane,"Sebastian was very helpful and welcoming. The accommodation was exactly as described, clean comfortable and quiet. Highly recommended <br/>"

12140520,79401596,2016-06-12,67018616,Paul,"Sebastian was very friendly and welcoming. The flat itself is in an amazing location, and the room was fine for my purposes - somewhere to crash overnight after a party."
12140520,80635387,2016-06-19,3966320,Ariel,"The perfect airbnb host, he represents all the best airbnb has to offer. A lovely space, you would not normally get to visit, an easy and elegant host. Very clean and well appointed apartment."
12140520,81268715,2016-06-22,1111960,Lisa,"Sebastian really has a lovely place in a great area. Both the room and bathroom were extremely clean. Before my trip, Sebastian provided comprehensive information and directions, and check-in was very quick and easy. Cannot recommend this place enough!"
12140520,81938078,2016-06-25,467055,Jennifer,Another very pleasant stay at Sebastian's comfortable apartment. I really appreciated the convenient location and ease of access.
12140520,82560230,2016-06-28,47069143,Gillian,"I had a great stay at Sebastian's flat in Shoreditch. The location was awesome - so close to the Old St tube stop which made it really convenient getting to/from the airport. Also the neighborhood was very vibrant with a lot of things to do. The flat itself was great and my room was very private on the top floor and was able to come and go as I please. Sebastian was very responsive and accommodating. Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here to others. "
12140520,83270391,2016-07-02,5374287,Highway,"Our associate stayed at this lovely room in July, during a 5-day writing meeting for our upcoming project ""Phone Home"".<br/>According to her, the location is incredible and Sebastian is amazing, helpful and very descript.<br/>So, Highway Productions would definitely recomment this Old St Single room!<br/>Thank you, Sebastian."
12140520,83795979,2016-07-04,38735400,Jana,"I had a very nice stay at Sebastian's place, although I did not spend much time in the apartment and came mostly only to sleep. Sebastian has been a very kind host and the room is small but perfectly comfortable and clean. The room is located on a separate floor, with another room, which is also rented, the bathroom (to be shared with the other guest) and a separate entrance, which provides a lot of independence. There is no lock on the room door, but during my stay someone came to check the installation, so there should be locks on the doors to both rooms soon. Also, a new blind was installed during my stay. Nice and modern bathroom with shower and bathtub. I forgot to ask for access to the roof terrace which is shown on the pictures, so I cannot say anything about that. All in all, a nice accommodation in a vibrant area, I would absolutely stay again!"
12140520,84520806,2016-07-07,4598303,Csaba,"I spent 3 nights in Sebastian's single room that was neat and clean when I arrived. The location is great, well connected with public transport yet quiet enough so I could sleep with the window open. <br/>Sebastian is a very attentive host: provided all essential information, gave advice when I asked, and was open just to chat."
12140520,85045864,2016-07-10,80922342,Luke,I wasn't sure what to expect for my first time using Airbnb but Sebastian did a brilliant job of making me feel welcome. He talked me through everything telling me to make myself at home which was very easy. I'm glad this was his thought process and amazed he followed through because I am someone who because of my work I finish most of my days at about 1-3am the next morning. Very happy with the service I received from Sebastian even before I turned up including clear instructions on how to find the place. Very highly recommended and will return.
12140520,86461673,2016-07-16,4523519,Julius,"Sebastian was a great host, location is perfect and flat is nice and clean in a really cool building. "
12140520,88048202,2016-07-23,74450996,Shawn,"This was my first time using Airbnb so I didn't really know what to expect. Sebastian was an amazing and communicative host, he made me feel at home and was very helpful with any questions I had. The room is small but cozy, with private access to the floor the room is on. The rest of the flat is beautiful, such a nice flat! Very central location, with many transport links. Lots of bars and restaurants nearby.  <br/><br/>Overall, it was a very nice stay and would highly recommend! <br/><br/>"
12140520,88556558,2016-07-24,49196032,Elena,"I booked Sebastian's place for my mum who was visiting from Italy and decided to spend a weekend in London. From the very beginning, Sebastian was great at communicating and event sent us directions to his place in Italian to make it easier for my mum! Mum really enjoyed her stay, she described it as a gorgeous building and she said about the flat that Sebastian has great taste :) The room is small but cosy and equipped with everything you need, and the separate entrance is very convenient. She also loved the location. And Sebastian even offered to post a top that she had forgotten. Would definitely recommend!"
12140520,89572560,2016-07-29,72438796,Helene,Seb was extremely welcoming and made all guests feel at home. The location is absolutely fantastic and couldn't be closer to a tube station. Really comfortable room and a relaxing hub right in the centre of London. I would highly recommend.
12140520,90142691,2016-07-31,11191660,Roger,Sebastian was very responsive with communication throughout the whole process. He was flexible with my travel schedule and allowed me to check in early which was very appreciated. He was also helpful with recommending with best ways to get to and from the apartment. The apartment was as described in the listing. I didn't explore the neighborhood but there are a couple good coffee shops right below the apartment and its also right at a tube stop. 
12140520,94839945,2016-08-17,87368958,Adrien,"Superbe première expérience avec Airbnb! Sebastian était très sympathique et accueillant! L'imperial Hall est un superbe bâtiment à 1 minute du métro londonien, et se situe non loin du quartier très cool de Shoreditch."
12140520,95297587,2016-08-19,50589418,Richard,"Sebastian is a gracious, interesting and communicative host. The apartment is lovely, even better than the photos, spotlessly clean and within a beautiful building in the heart of Shoreditch."

12140520,98828546,2016-09-02,36194366,Emma,"I had a bumpy arrival (times changed twice) and Sebastian was more than accommodating to help me check-in easily.<br/><br/>On arrival, he immediately got me connected on wifi and showed me the room, which was very spacious for a single room.<br/><br/>The nicest surprise was the travel essentials stocked up in the bathroom; shower gel, shampoo, toothpaste and toothbrush.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent host and would stay here again."

12140520,103717032,2016-09-24,83315593,Kayla,"This flat is in a terrific neighborhood far away enough from the tourists but close enough to everything so that if you need to come back during the day, you can. The building is very secure and having a separate entrance is fantastic. Sebastian was very pleasant and easy to talk to, but he also let me do my own thing, which was great."
12140520,104101765,2016-09-25,16552854,Joseph,The room was simple and everything I needed. So close to the underground rail. Super easy to get around the city from this spot.
12140520,105846937,2016-10-03,29122376,Olguța-Roxana,"I booked the single room at Sebastian's place for 5 nights and I can't recommend this place more! This was my first Airbnb experience and I didn't know what to expect. The location is great, safe, central and well connected and the apartment itself is amazing! Guests can use their own entrance if you feel that you need more privacy. Sebastian has been a great host and I must say that it's a pleasure to have a chat with him! He lets his guests have their own space and is not intrusive at all but if you would like to have a conversation with him you will find out what a great guy he is! He really does make you feel like home! <br/>I highly recommend Sebastian as being an amazing Airbnb host! "
12140520,106315716,2016-10-05,97493179,Emma,Delightful stay with Sebastian who is charming and welcoming beyond expectations. The flat is lovely and I really appreciated being able to relax on the comfortable sofa. Spotlessly clean and great bathroom with bath and shower. I hope to stay again.

12140520,108231056,2016-10-15,97631747,Dorothy,"Sebastian is a world class host.  He invited me into his fabulous flat as if it were mine and he'd known me for years. And, in fact, in no time, I was wishing it was mine indeed and that I'd known him forever!  <br/>Location is fantastic and wonderfully accessible. Bed may be the most comfortable support for my aging back I've ever experienced.  Bath is divine!   A soaking tub,  bar none.  A perfect stay in every way. Cannot recommend highly enough.  Enjoyed immensely!"
12140520,111207764,2016-10-30,1579269,Brett,Sebastian was London's first ever Airbnb host and his experience really came to the fore during my stay. Check in was warm and welcoming and I was quickly able to start exploring London. His accomodation is very well located - easy to each from either Heathrow or Gatwick - and near good bars and restaurants. The flat is spacious and modern and everything is kept perfectly clean. Extra points for one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in at an Airbnb booking. When I come back to London I'll definitely consider staying at Sebastian's place again.

12140520,114426835,2016-11-18,12340202,Jamil,"Sebastian is one of London's original Air BnB hosts and boy does it show! He responded quickly to my questions, was kind enough to ask about my flight details so he would know when to expect me, and then when I arrived, welcomed me with a lovely coffee while giving me tips on how to get around town and interesting spots.<br/><br/>The flat itself is very conveniently located. Literally a 20 second walk from a tube station (Northern Line) and close to all of the action in Shoreditch and the City.<br/><br/>The flat is a split/multi-level unit. The bottom floor is the kitchen and common area and has lots of natural light and open space. Decor is modern and comfortable. Up the stairs, at the top level are the guest rooms and bathroom. My room was comfy with ample space to hang my clothes. <br/><br/>There was a little balcony as well which I didn't make use of. On the nightstand there was a binder with pages full of suggestions of nearby places to see or get a bite/coffee which was very helpful.<br/><br/>The bathroom had extra toothbrushes and little toothpastes and soaps etc, which is really clever since folks often forget these little things when traveling.<br/><br/>A fantastic stay at a lovely flat in a great part of town with a very friendly host. I would recommend staying at Sebastian's place to anyone.<br/>"
12140520,114799929,2016-11-20,13019534,Olga,Perfect stay for a weekend trip. Although Sebastian was not home communication was very good and he made sure everything was allright.

His home is beautiful, attention to detail really appreciated (towels and toiletries available) and he is extremely welcoming, sociable and happy to give his guests space whilst allowing them to treat his home like our own :) <br/><br/>The location is also fab, so close to the tube and central to amenities and touristy stuff.  His place will be top of my list next time I'm in London!"

12140520,121323002,2016-12-16,29508061,Gloria,"This was the first time that I stayed in an Airbnb location where the owner of the property was concurrently residing on the property during my stay.  Any advance trepidation I may have had about this arrangement was quickly allayed upon my arrival, thanks to the warm and congenial welcome I received from Sebastian, and the way in which the stay was arranged.  The fantastic layout of the property allows options both for privacy and for interaction in and access to the common living areas; during my stay, I enjoyed and took advantage of both.  This included a shared dinner the first evening; a full day working peacefully on a project on my computer in the common living area; three extended days doing only work/conference activities away from the flat after which I came back to the flat to rest quietly; and an open and flexible invitation to join in an event Sebastian was hosting one night during that week (which I attended enjoyed thoroughly). I was especially impressed and reassured by Sebastian's  clear and timely communication throughout my stay.  I also found him to be a lively and sensitive conversationalist when we found opportunity to talk.  He anticipated and honored my needs as a guest from beginning to end, while also respecting my privacy; this was a balance he struck with a finesse clearly born of his extensive experience serving as an Airbnb host.   The flat is spotlessly clean and exactly as described in the listing.  Excellent and quiet location, yet also near amenities and a few steps from a tube stop. It was a short walk to City University of London, where my conference was being held.  I cannot imagine better.  Despite my busy schedule and the fact that this was primarily a working trip, it turned quite pleasantly into an especially enjoyable working trip and a miniature vacation thanks to Sebastian and his hospitality.  Thank you, Sebastian!"

Exactly as described, the room was simply furnished with a single bed, table, chair and closet; everything was impeccably clean and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The bathroom was an easy step down the hallway and I appreciated having a separate entrance so I wouldn't disturb anyone while coming or going.  The bathroom was well equipped and the shower had good water pressure and no end of hot water.  I occasionally work from my company's London office quite close by and won't hesitate to stay with Sebastien again!"

12140520,146081964,2017-04-21,71240608,Anna Lena,"The apartment is in seriously the best location you could imagine. My office was in Shoreditch and I could mainly walked everywhere, which never happens in London. I really enjoyed my stay as this is one of my favourite areas in town. <br/><br/>The apartment is spacious, modern clean and Sebastian is a lovely, welcoming host who respects your privacy but also is happy to invite you for a chat at the kitchen table, if you wish. <br/><br/>The room is upstairs with separate bathroom, which gives you a lot of privacy. Everything was very clean and the bathroom was well-equipped with toiletries which was for someone who travels with hand luggage (like me) fantastic! <br/><br/>I can definitely recommend this place to anyone and would love to come back next time I'm in town. "
12140520,147674468,2017-04-28,10047424,Simon,"Perfect base for my first week back in London.

12140520,156800229,2017-06-01,61440655,Laura,"Had an awesome time in London staying at Sebastian's. The flat is right next to a tube station, located close to everything of interest and a close walk for coffee or food. Seb was there to meet me, the room was simple but it was all I needed for my stay. It was also cool to hang out with him whenever we were both there at the same time. I would love to stay there again. Thanks!"
12140520,158777689,2017-06-08,22851294,Melissa,"Sebastian was so sweet and accommodating, I was worried as a female solo traveler about staying places but I would stay again with him in a heartbeat! Very close to the tube stop! "
12140520,160227046,2017-06-13,6291337,Cecilia,Sebastian was a great host. His casa is your casa. Conveniently near  the Tube. <br/>Was a female solo traveler - felt safe and comfortable going in and out of the apt. Clean apt. Delightful host. I recommend it. <br/>

12140520,163079631,2017-06-23,6337106,Yann,Visited for work in The City. Sebastian is a charming fellow bursting with stories and (especially political) knowledge. Made for riveting conversation and an attentive host. The place is larger than the pictures suggest and located directly next to Old Street station. Would recommend for anyone looking to stay centrally.
12140520,163780725,2017-06-25,673136,Chris,"Sebastian is a lovely host, very energetic and welcoming. The flat is very conveniently located for walking around to shops, nightlife, and cafes and I had no problems getting in and out. In terms of value and convenience, I'd rate my stay highly. <br/><br/>A couple notes: you may end up sharing the bathroom with another Airbnb guest in the room next door to yours, and you may be able to hear noise as they come and go. A good set of earplugs will avoid any sleep interruptions caused by this proximity (you can individually lock your room).<br/><br/>Speaking of earplugs, there seemed to be a lot of street and construction noise that leaked into the room during my stay. It's in the city, so that's not unusual, but something to consider if you're sensitive to sound. <br/><br/>And speaking of sensitivities, if you don't like the smell of , you may be put off by the occasional smell that lingers up from the lower floor. Even with the door closed to the downstairs, a slight odor would find its way up to the hallway leading to the bedroom from time to time. <br/><br/>Generally these were minor issues and didn't erode the overall experience of my stay. YMMV.<br/><br/>"
12140520,165226439,2017-06-30,14173820,Yakub,Sebastian's place was perfect for my first visit to London. It is located literally right above Old Street station so it was incredibly easy to find. He was extremely communicative leading up to my stay and personally greeted me and made sure I had everything I needed. The single room and bathroom were clean and well appointed with towels and a plethora of toiletries provided. I had a lovey chat with Sebastian over coffee and he even helped with my laundry. Perfect!!
12140520,167674490,2017-07-07,9465908,Danielle,"This was my second stay with Sebastian and it did not disappoint!  The single room was again simply furnished just as described and impeccably clean, Sebastian was very flexible and easy to communicate with about check in.

12140520,198163455,2017-09-28,5650608,Meg,"Sebastian and this flat were both fantastic. He was communicative, flexible, and provided all the basic essentials like shampoo, hair dryer, toothbrush/toothpaste, etc. The location was perfect - super walkable but also only a few steps off the Old Street northern line stop, so you could get anywhere in the city very quickly. Highly recommended!"
12140520,199562491,2017-10-02,49869974,Clarissa,"Sebastian is an extremely welcoming and thoughtful host. The location is ideal, as it is literally only steps from the Old Street Underground station. Everything was clean and well supplied, and the room was very comfortable. Sebastian has thoughtfully arranged a book of tips that he leaves in the room, which has useful information even for someone who has visited the area before. I would happily stay with Sebastian again should the chance arise."
12140520,201843044,2017-10-09,141313558,Jackie,Sebastian's place was fantastic for my weeklong stay in London while I did research for my degree.  It is located right near the underground and I was able to travel all around the city painlessly thanks to the location.  The room was clean and very comfortable and the building itself is super impressive!
12140520,202653122,2017-10-12,115520142,Malachy,An excellent location - public transport options are extensive and right on the doorstep. Comfortable and clean.<br/><br/>Sebastian is a genuinely welcoming host. What he says about his home being yours is absolutely true.

12140520,210425850,2017-11-09,2691292,Ai-Lien,"Sebastian was an attentive host, adjusting to my delayed arrival and knowing right away where to get my Vietnamese food fix! Despite the building location being on a busy street (taking the tube and bus was super easy), I was able to sleep comfortably and soundly in my cozy room without much street noise - and that's coming from someone who's a light sleeper.<br/><br/>For bars and restaurants, you just need to walk outside the building door. Shoreditch and Hoxton neighborhoods are just a couple minutes walking distance so you don't need to go far for great food and drinks. I would highly recommend staying at Sebastian's place and look forward to returning there in the future!"
12140520,211959208,2017-11-15,76724363,Michelle,Sebastian is a super host! He is nice and friendly. The location is great and I can’t ask for more.

12140520,227226696,2018-01-14,56678220,Rifatra,"Sebastian’s place is at central location, very close to the tube station and shorditch.

Wat een prachtig pand in levendige buurt , met street art, markten etc. Tegenover een metrostation waar vandaan je overal komt.

12140520,340829202,2018-10-25,193650452,Simon,Sebastian is a lovely man who welcomed me personally and offered me the use of his own living space as well as the room itself.  The property is quite beautiful and the room was very clean and comfortable. The location is great with excellent travel connection just a stone's throw from the property. The only downside of my stay was being to busy to spend more time with host who seems like somebody you could have a fantastic conversation with. - Can't recommend it enough.
12140520,341562569,2018-10-27,18759357,Allyson,"I appreciate the quick responses and clear communication with Sebastian, he allowed me to check-in early,  provided clear directions and his place was easily accessible by tube. I had forgotten my adapter and messaged him, he responded quickly and even came up to the room with a box of adapters! Very accommodating to my basic needs and requests. I appreciated the separate entrance and privacy. Location is great, Starbucks next door, bars and food places just a stone throw away, chicken spot across the street hits the spot and laundry across the street is also convenient. I would definitely recommend to others and would stay again!"
12140520,343407753,2018-10-31,38032234,Dominic,"This is the second time I've stayed with Sebastian, and he was as kind, helpful, and thoughtful as the last time. It's a fantastic apartment (good wifi, always very clean, and everything you need to have a comfortable stay) with a wonderful host in a perfect location in London."
12140520,344865240,2018-11-04,4906554,Corinne,Amazing location.  Incredibly gracious host and exactly as advertised.  I’d recommend this listing without question.
12140520,346114006,2018-11-07,365744,Tove Margrethe,"Great stay  for 2 nights in connection with a conference in London. Very close to the tube, and lots og good places to eat or get a coffe close by.  Good value for money."

12140520,348308651,2018-11-13,38032234,Dominic,"I've now stayed with Sebastian several times, and he's by far the best Airbnb host I've ever had. His apartment is beautiful and centrally located, he's very thoughtful and great for conversation. Highly recommended!"

12140520,356493601,2018-12-08,218270198,Yinon,"One of the first ABB on the planet, and there's no question Sebastian sets a high standard for all other hosts. The location is great, the apartment is nice, the rooms are quite isolated for those who seek privacy, and Sebastian is super cool and nice. Ill definitely visit again."
12140520,357928200,2018-12-12,80192323,James,Comfortable bed in a quiet room with nice bathroom (shared but not a problem).  Sebastian is a very welcoming host with a nice centrally located flat.  Bedroom a little basic but comfortable and was still quiet even though so close to main road and Old street station.  Overall very good for the price.
12140520,360365990,2018-12-20,224423758,Ludovic,"Sebastian was a fantastic host, very accommodating and helpful. I would highly recommend his place to anyone, the location is fantastic right next to the metro and a short walk from many sights. The place is very welcoming and perfect for a few nights stay."
12140520,361359964,2018-12-23,36315105,安倍,Sebastian is very kind
12140520,401897523,2019-01-16,61665286,Vincenzo,I had an amazing experience at Sebastians place. You can see that he's a host from day one because he knows what hosting in airbnb is about. The bed is very comfy and the apartment modern and central. I hope to stay at Sebastians place again very soon.
12140520,403199938,2019-01-20,196066617,Sally,"I would recommend this accommodation. It is lovely, clean and near to all public transport."
12140520,406921593,2019-01-31,39963001,Jessica,"Great spot, just steps to the underground station, a bus stop, coffee shops and food. I highly recommend it! The location was so convenient that I was able to do all the sightseeing I wanted to do while there and then some, easily! Sebastian is a great host. He is so warm and welcoming - a lovely person! He was very responsive through the app whenever I had questions. I had a great vacation to London and having a homely stay definitely contributed to it going so smoothly.   <br/><br/>My sightseeing adventures over 10 days (all or most just 10-30 minute away from the Airbnb): Tower Bridge • Buckingham Palace • Changing of the guards • Kensington Palace • Tower of London • Big Ben (under renovation) • The London Eye • London Dungeon • Madame Tussaud’s • Westminster Abbey • Palace of Westminster • The Monument • Hyde Park • Regents Park • St. James’s Park • Camden Market • Covent Garden • St Paul’s Cathedral • The London Bridge • Trafalgar Square • Poppies Fish n Chips • The Old Fountain Pub • Harry Potter Tour: Platform 9 3/4, Diagon Alley, The Clink Prison, The Ministry of Magic, The Millennium Bridge, The Leaky Cauldron, The Golden Hind Pirate Ship, Borough Market, Cecil Court, Palace Theatre, Great Scotland Yard Road, 10 Downing Street, Goodman’s Court, Knockturn <br/><br/>Sebastian, Thank you so much for your kindness and hospitality.

It was very nice meeting you and I enjoyed our chats. Thank you for being so responsive and accommodating during my stay! I hope you take care."
12140520,408974385,2019-02-06,215005289,Agnes,Chambre toute simple mais fonctionnelle. Bon rapport qualité/prix par rapport à son emplacement dans Londres (à côte de la station Old street). Sebastian est très sympathique et réactif dans la réponse à nos messages.
12140520,411984216,2019-02-14,239021646,Hector,Great place!
12140520,415333992,2019-02-22,9636548,Diane,"location is perfect, Sebastian is very friendly and quick to respond to booking. Happy to recommend and would stay again. "
12140520,416341792,2019-02-24,93316380,Adrian,"Sebastian has been a great host and makes me feel like home! <br/><br/>The location is very strategic to bus & underground station - and also to many places in London town (from Tower Bridge, Big Ben, Eye of London, Museums to Camden Town). Highly recommended!"
12140520,417192465,2019-02-26,231169744,Gabriel,"My very first Airbnb experience and I’m more than pleased to say Sebastian was much more than just a host... he is a genuine friend. <br/><br/>Available from the very moment I arrived at the door, instructions we very clear and getting to the apartment was really easy given it’s right next to old street station. The building itself is located in a busy zone yet somehow it feels really peaceful and quiet within the flat. Very convenient if you don’t like walking long distances to your nearest tube stop. <br/>The room where I stayed, was just as pictured. A cozy small room with a small bed (suitable for couples that don’t mind cuddling long nights) and a picturesque window overlooking an outdoor area of the flat. <br/>This place will definitely become a tradition whenever I’m back in London. <br/>My favorite part was how Sebastian always made sure you felt at home. The first night he cooked a delicious supper and made sure I had my dose of coffee in the morning. Accompanied with world class conversations! I can confidently say I am <br/>100% satisfied."
12140520,417745449,2019-02-28,2231955,Tom,"Sebastian is a considerate, charming and generous host who has created more than just a  great place to stay in central London, but a space where I met and made new friends. He has a gift for hospitality which has put his home on my personal list of favourite AirBnbs in London."
12140520,422875539,2019-03-12,70861564,June,"sebastian welcomes you with kind and open hospitality. his home is very comfortable, modern and clean. the location was ideal in being very close by Old St underground station that enables easy travel to and around London. i highly recommend staying there. thank you sebastian!"
12140520,423521222,2019-03-14,210985578,Iwan,"Sebastian's flat is really modern and stylish, he makes you feel welcome and at home to make use of the large common space. The bedroom was a decent size for a single room and spotless. Sebastians hospitality is second to none, he is very friendly open minded and we had some good conversation. I will be returning!"
12140520,426522075,2019-03-21,210985578,Iwan,"This is my second stay in Sebastian’s flat. He is a fantastic host, very accommodating and always kind and helpful. The flat is very stylish and sparking clean."

12140520,448603671,2019-05-05,20666178,Dustin,"For a first-time London visit, Sebastian was a saint. Took the time to give me some tips and made me feel at home. Super-appreciative."
12140520,450357052,2019-05-09,9526669,Emilie & François,"I found Sebastien's apartment messy when he greeted me, and I admit to being surprised but not in a good way.  I had warned Sebastian that I wanted to leave my luggage early and leave again.<br/><br/>After that, Sebastian told me that I will have a room with a private bathroom and toilets. I discovered that I had to share my bathroom with a newcomer, a man who will arrive the next day ! I was very surprised in a bad way for the second time. <br/><br/>Sebastian look cool but I discovered also that the bed linen was dirty and the carpet smelled bad. I did not feel comfortable and I choose to look for another place to stay. <br/><br/>I’m sorry for that. I travelled a lot and sleep often in Airbnb rooms and it is the first time it’s happened to me."
12140520,456748987,2019-05-22,30826032,Laura,Sebastian’s apartment is perfectly located and easy to access. It’s perfectly safe thanks to a lock on the door and has everything you need even for a business stay.

12140520,488716908,2019-07-15,73656909,Jillian,"I had a wonderful experience at Sebastian's flat! The apartment was impeccably clean, stylish, and centrally located. Transit was so simple with the underground a few steps away. Highly recommend and would stay again!"
12140520,499449226,2019-07-31,82900247,Ayako,"Thank you Sebastion for your help and hospitality. On arrival day at Sebastion's place, I was suffering from being bitten by a bug at a festival outside. H kindly took me to a pharmacy and explained to a shop staff, which was really kind. There are two rooms except his room. It was not convenient when two women moved in to one of the rooms and when we had to share a bath room. Someone was using it when I wanted to. Other than that, my stay was really comfortable with all facilities and equipment I needed, the location is quite convenient and safe located next to the station. In addition to it,  that was nice to have had a chance to communicate and socialize with the other guests and Sebastion. I think this is one of the best features of using Airbnb.<br/>Sebastion is kind and willing to help you. I'm looking forward to going back to Sebastion's place again!"
12140520,511531012,2019-08-17,229771076,Linda,Such a convenient location.  The closest intersection is currently under construction. It will be even better for pedestrians soon!

Lots of cafes, banks and shops within steps of the apartment. <br/>The room was very cozy and clean. It was very welcoming at the end of a long day exploring busy London.<br/>All around, an excellent base in the city.<br/>Sebastian was very welcoming and on hand if I had any questions."

12140520,541415656,2019-10-05,162188432,Michael,Sebastian’s place could not have been in a better location. Awesome apartment and the rooftop was the perfect place for my morning coffee
12140520,545967490,2019-10-13,173565897,Sarah,This is a great place. The host is very friendly and lets you feel like his home is your home. Definitely would stay here again.
12140520,560598694,2019-11-07,5965829,Emilie,I really enjoyed my stay at Sebastian's! <br/>The building in itself is amazing. Ask Sebastian about the rooftop! <br/>I felt really secure there.  The room is small but cosy with a closet. Both room and bathroom were very clean.<br/>It's easy to set the temperature on the radiator.  Lots of sockets with USB plugs.<br/>Tea and coffee available in the kitchen. <br/>I hope to be back soon!
12140520,562064334,2019-11-10,239771609,Peter,"Sebastian was very supportive and flexible, despite Lufthansa canceling flights. The apartment was clean, modern and quiet. Thank you very much, I can only recommend."

12140520,569397907,2019-11-26,38356145,Ersin,"I've seen hunderds of compliments before I booked the place, but both Sebastian and his place turned out to be well above my already high expectations. The location is just great, you can get wherever you like in London less than 30mins, and most of the places you'd like to visit are in walking distance. The rooms are much better than they look in the pictures (you wouldn't expect that to happen on Airbnb, would you?), bed was very comfortable and the entire place was sparkling clean. Sebastian is a great host, one of the best I dare to say. Highly recommended!"
12140520,570829679,2019-11-30,296374131,Makenzi,"GREAT host! I was here on Holiday. If I ever return to London, I will definitely stay here again!"
12140520,572639878,2019-12-03,282284640,Vincent,"Seb's place is a brilliant apartment located smack above the Old St tube station. You can expect a super clean room/bathroom/apartment, the single being quite large with an in-built wardrobe. The only thing I'd be wary of is door slamming if you have inconsiderate neighbours in the double room nextdoor (all other sounds are surprisingly muted, even the bathroom down the hall is near silent). Seb is also full of conversation if you're up for it and I got lots of handy tips (and a few beers) for my few days in London. Highly recommend and will be back."
12140520,573132355,2019-12-05,7256432,Elisa,"Sebastian’s place is perfect for visiting London. Flat is divided in three floors so the bedroom is very quiet and peaceful. Sebastian himself is incredibly kind host, he really made me feel at home. I will definitely return!"
12140520,575176816,2019-12-09,227766182,Kattis,My third time staying with Sebastian. Always a positive experience.

12140520,593941366,2020-01-17,35197344,Mitali,"Sebastian's place was great - probably the best location of an airbnb I have ever stayed in! The room was cosy and comfortable with all helpful touches like towels, shampoo, showergel, etc. Minimal noise from the street. There are a decent number of stairs in the apartment to the bedroom but not a problem for me. Unfortunately I was working on an assignment so I didnt get to spend much time with Sevastian or my fellow airbnb guest though."
12140520,594946447,2020-01-19,132706015,Katie,"I loved the facilities, the apartment was very convenient to transportation, and my hosts were very prompt and helpful in  answering my questions.  They were so considerate and thoughtful (I don’t know if it was on purpose, but as a theatre worker and “newer” traveler I appreciated the copy of Doll’s House and books about London on the bedside table), and the whole place was immaculate.  Sebastian recommended an app to help me get around town on my own, and Tom was so helpful when I had questions during my stay and when I accidentally spilt coffee upstairs.  If you’re looking for a clean, quiet room with a comfy bed and a great price, I can’t recommend a better host!"
12140520,597941617,2020-01-26,830476,Pelle,"Good location and good privacy on a separate floor, shared with another guest room."
12140520,598892958,2020-01-28,328118400,Jimmy,"Sebastian was a very generous and considerate host. As a first timer to London, he provided his ideas of the best ways for me to go around the city, which turned out to be very successful. Lovely place, highly recommend!"
12140520,599808625,2020-01-31,64081026,Katherine,Great room for a solo traveller. Good location right next to the tube in an interesting area. I felt very comfortable there as a solo female traveller. Sebastian was a friendly and hospitable host and was accommodating of early check-ins/late check-outs. The room and bathroom were clean and the apartment was well-outfitted. Thanks!
12140520,600774125,2020-02-02,11469847,Nadine,"Sebastian is very nice, everything was smooth and super clean. The bed is comfy and the area features loads of restaurants, bars and nightlife. Certainly a good place to spend your hours in London! And check out that rooftop!"

12140520,705031515,2020-10-30,39114250,Auberon,My friend stayed at Sebastian's apartment for 10 days while working in London and loved it! Great location situated on the corner of Old Street station. Seb's hospitality was outstanding - couldn't recommend the place enough!
12140520,706391256,2020-11-03,279238105,Aran,"Sebastian is a fantastic host, great chef and a genuinely kind person. The apt has been the perfect stay for the past few days! Again cannot wait to be back! Take care Seb!"
12140520,744585192,2021-04-02,393027069,Rory,"I really enjoyed my time at Sebastian's place, I honestly can't imagine there's too many places in London that are nicer to stay at than this place. The flat itself is spectacular, the roof terrace in particular is definitely a highlight especially in the summer time. The location is perfect, right in the centre, have Shoreditch right on your doorstep but it also feels secluded and quiet once inside the building. As for the host, Sebastian couldn't have made me feel more at home, really friendly and welcoming. Thanks!"
12140520,755759261,2021-05-07,111591631,Harvey,Sebastian’s place was a delight to stay at and I would happily return. The location is fantastic for everything East London has to offer.
12140520,758289963,2021-05-15,10048591,Beverlee,"Great host, fabulous apartment in stunning building, especially the huge deep bath with blue lighting.  Definitely grab a coffee and croissant from Pret next door and take it up to the roof terrace and watch the sun come up. Great value for money."
12140520,760324937,2021-05-20,35179389,Robert,"Sebastian's place was perfect for my 3 day stay - great location and Sebastian was a gracious host, very helpful and happy to chat if we were both in the kitchen/lounge."
12140520,765307121,2021-06-01,88212015,Jeniffer,"Loved this room. Sebastian is a lovely host - very kind and personable. The room and bathroom was neat and clean and had everything I needed. The room is located a very close walking distance to many great bars and restaurants, and is a 30 second walk to the tube to get you anywhere you wanted to go. I will absolutely stay here again on my next travels to London. Thank you!"
12140520,396846486972357323,2021-07-01,218455558,Kamran,I wouldn't stay here again <br/><br/>No key for the room I stayed in so stuff could have got stolen when out. <br/><br/>I didn't have an issue until the night the lights went out and I had to wait 40 minutes in darkness in a shower with shampoo on my hair and eyes. imagine if I was disabled. Then being acused of smoking and arguing with a slightly intoxicated old fella close to midnight is not cool at all. It should have been dealt with more urgently!
12140520,468588378682583523,2021-10-08,48120246,Nelson,"Checking in was a breeze. Communication with Sebastian was fantastic. The location is prime and the tube station is literally next door. The Airbnb was as described - clean, comfortable, & had all the essentials plus more. All in all, Sebastian was an amazing host. Certainly one of the most hospitable and accommodating hosts I’ve encountered. I definitely recommend."

12140520,488961695281629489,2021-11-05,134950194,FuDarrius,Sebastian is an amazing host. There is a load of room & essentials that will make you stay much better.
12140520,493346786079956600,2021-11-11,4997204,Steve,"This is ideal for a single traveller who plans to spend most of his/her time exploring London outside the flat. The area is vibrant and central. Sebastian's 3-floor flat is in a large Victorian building right off the Old St. roundabout. The room faces inward, which is what you want as there is little noise despite the proximity to traffic. Sebastian welcomed me to use the main floor with its kitchen, but generally I took advantage of a completely separate (essentially private) entrance to the floor where my room and the one other guest room are located. Everything was clean and the bathroom, shared between the two guest rooms, was spacious, modern, immaculate, and well-appointed. Promixity to the tube was extremely convenient. Finally, communication w/ Sebastian was excellent. I would stay again under the same circumstances."

Not too far from the centre but at the same time feels much calmer than the buzzing city centre, which is nice in the evening. Silvia was truly lovely to us, always available if needed, she offered to watch TV with her and made us feel comfortable. She can also leave you on your own if you prefer to just relax in your room, which is always lovely at the end of the day. Will become our place to stay at in London in the future: wonderful place, exceptional host, what else can you ask for!"

12942295,89348358,2016-07-28,71181132,Nina,Silvia is by far the best host I've met since using Air BnB. She went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and welcome.

Celle-ci est très disponible et discrète. Nous avons eu une discussion fort intéressante le matin de notre départ et avons failli louper notre train : ). <br/>Nous ne manquerons pas de retourner dans ce logement lors de notre prochain passage sur Londres.<br/>"
12942295,90973915,2016-08-03,22076929,Nadine,"Silvia was great. Most welcoming and incredibly helpful in assisting me in navigating the tube system and suggesting things to do. She provided a lovely breakfast and what a gorgeous position to eat it in, looking out over her lovely garden where a little squirrel comes out to play each morning. I was in the double room which had a nice view over the garden and was very quiet. How luxurious to sleep between ironed sheets. Shared bathroom was never an issue. Her house is close to station. Great area. I had trouble with my phone sim and there was a nearby shop to help which is great for travellers. The High Street shops are interesting with lots of diverse eateries and a real multi-cultural feel. I wish I had been able to stay longer as I felt very at home and this was a great introduction to friendly helpful English people of which there are many but Silvia is a prime example. "
12942295,91069324,2016-08-03,4413533,Janet,"Silvia's home in the Willesden Green area of London was perfect for our last night stay before leaving England for home. Our room was very comfortable and clean. And Silvia was the nicest host possible! She helped us determine the best way to get to Heathrow. (We found that it would be cheaper to take an Uber from her home to Heathrow than just an Uber to Paddington Station and then two rail tickets to Heathrow.) Her home is in a working class area which felt safe and friendly. There is not a lot to see in the immediate neighborhood but it is very near the Willesden Green Tube station on the Jubilee line. If you don't have much luggage, then just take the Tube from her house to Heathrow. We took it to London Bridge and then had a nice evening at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. Very easy. Silvia also has a very friendly, laid back cat that we fell in love with. We had a breakfast of bagels, cereal, and fruit in her kitchen and had lovely conversation with Silvia. "

Oh...not to forget a lovely cat too.<br/><br/>Silvia was so great and lovely, she insisted to prepare us breakfast even we told her we gotta leave very early to bath. <br/><br/>We love the 2 nights we spent in Silvia's house.

12942295,99765987,2016-09-05,89980693,Natascha,"Alles war wie es auf Silvias Seite angegeben war. Sie war sehr gastfreundlich und zuvorkommend und hat mit allen Mitteln versucht, uns den Aufenthalt so angenehm wie möglich zu gestalten. Silvia war immer für Fragen offen und hat sehr ausführlich geantwortet. Sie hat jeden Morgen ein leckeres und ausreichendes Frühstück zur Verfügung gestellt. Die Wohnung ist von der Lage für einen Städtetrip super, obwohl sie nicht direkt im Zentrum liegt. Man läuft nur 2 Minuten zur Undergroundstation und erreicht in 15 Minuten die Sehenswürdigkeiten. Die Wohnung ist sehr altmodisch, aber trotzdem sauber. Praktisch war auch, dass wir den Kühlschrank mitbenutzen durften. Check-In und Check-Out verliefen einwandfrei und ohne Probleme und wir durften am Abreisetag sogar unsere Koffer bei ihr bis abends abstellen.<br/>Thank you very much Silvia :)"

12942295,103224178,2016-09-21,67157899,Liisbet,"Staying with Silvia was like visiting family (in the best possible way). I stayed there for just one night on very short notice with a friend, since the move-in date to our own flat in London got unexpectedly postponed, but the experience was so lovely, I wished we could have stayed longer.<br/>Silvia was so incredibly friendly and sweet from the moment we got there and provided us with everything we might need. There were even little chocolates and bottles of water left for us in the bedroom!<br/>The house itself is really cool, high ceilings and has a lovely rustic and cozy feel to it. The bedroom was roomy, the bed huge and very-very comfortable. Everything was clean, tidy and neat.<br/>Probably the best part was the continental breakfast Silvia had waiting for us when we woke up! We hadn't eaten proper breakfast for a week, so that was a very nice treat.<br/>The neighbourhood is nice and quiet, very close to transport links and only a tube ride away from central London.<br/>There's also a cat in the house, who was very cute and at one point came and asked very pointedly for belly rubs. We gladly obliged :) In the morning, there was a squirrel (whom Silvia feeds) welcoming us through the window. Supercute.<br/><br/>All in all, an absolutely delightful stay and Silvia's place, can't recommend it enough and if I wasn't living in my own flat in London now, I would definitely go and stay with her again anytime!"

The home of Silvia is lovely and well located, at one minute by walk to the underground station. It was really easy to visit all the city by subway.

12942295,467422415,2019-06-10,92938812,Arnaud,"Second time going to Silvia's, and it was as good as the first time (maybe even better?). She's an adorable person, always there for you and for your needs, she's open for evening chats, we really sleep well, everything is perfectly clean, her place is not to close to center but very easy to go to center as she lives at 3 minutes by foot from a metro station. Plus, if you love cats, you'll love the place even more ;) Do not hesitate to make reservation at her home if you plan on staying in London! At least, that's what me and my girlfriend will do next time we're visiting London, without a doubt! See you next time, Silvia! :)"

12942295,473907724,2019-06-22,22628190,Chloe,I barely write a review(too lazy)but this one I have to.Silvia is a stylish yet amusing person. She has gorgeous nail painting and a very chilled cat (with a busy daily schedule) She might find it hard to write more reviews as nice words are almost consumed up by her previous guests but I’ll leave this problem for her to tackle.<br/><br/>The room is sparkling clean and bright.<br/>The breakfast is simply unbeatable.

12942295,561952622,2019-11-10,157762767,Katrina,"I’ve had the best time with Silvia and I didn’t want to leave! Nothing is too much and Silvia cares about every aspect of your stay. Her flat is cosy, warm and just right for Airbnb. You are greeted by an array of birds, squirrels and a lovely, affectionate black “fat cat” called Honky at breakfast time. Breakfast is a delight, with toast, cereal, bagels, fruit and a range of spreads. <br/><br/>The tube station is a mere 2 minutes walk away but you can’t hear it when you’re going to bed. The tube is easy to work out and it’s only a quick 20 minute journey to central London. The area Silvia is located in is quiet and calm. <br/><br/>If I come back to London, I will definitely be staying with Silvia - it feels like I’ve come as a stranger but left as a friend. Would definitely recommend."
12942295,567756761,2019-11-23,230907842,Jenny,"As alway, Silvia made me feel very welcome. Her place is not only super convenient (2min walk from the station) but cosy, clean and stylish as well. <br/>Thank you Silvia for being a  such a super host."

Her home is beautiful full of character and charm and the room is warm, clean , spacious and cosy with such a comfortable bed.  It is so quiet and peaceful and I woke up to the sound of bird-song in the morning. Sylvia offers a  beautiful breakfast looking out into the garden which is a magical sanctuary where birds and squirrels play. Honky Tonk the cat is great company...full of charm and purrs. Sylvia is so thoughtful and even gave me a banana, an apple and some herbal tea to take with me for my day.  Great conversations over breakfast...I highly recommend staying here and hope I can return before too long. Such a lovely find..."

Also, the location is very close to subway station, rooms are very quiet at night, surely can have a great sleep.<br/>Definitely I love Honky, who is so cute, omg!! I really appreciated Silvia provided me such great breakfast in very early morning due to my appointment. Such a rememberable experience."

12942295,459948914736482603,2021-09-26,25250872,Michael,"Silvia's place is without a doubt the cleanest, cosiest and  all round best value AirBnb stay you could ask for in London. It's firstly a home lovingly maintained by Silvia who is very welcoming and has thought of everything to make staying at her home as comfortable as possible. It's also an ultra convenient location thats very close to the underground and is a quick journey to the centre of town. The moment you enter the room Silvia has prepared, your immediately sense it's a spacious and relaxing space that has an incredibly comfy bed  that provided me with a deep and refreshing sleep. There is an expansive park nearby that is great for long walks / jogs.  I was so grateful for every attention to detail by Silvia to make the stay a true rest and recuperation for the soul and If the opportunity should arise, I would only be glad to book again at some time in the future. Sending all my best wishes to you and Honky from Wales!"

13035561,83744170,2016-07-04,68872410,David,Lovely flat very close to Archway tube. Very nice place with everything you need. Hannah was relaxed and friendly. A lovely stay! 
13035561,87037755,2016-07-18,24338849,Dawn,Great apartment - really easy transport links - and very pretty inside. Hannah was easy to communicate with and very helpful. 
13035561,88972271,2016-07-26,14787157,Rachel,"My friend and I had a lovely 4 nights in Hannah's apartment. The space was clean, bright and roomy with a great atmosphere. The apartment is an easy 3 minute walk from Archway station, which is on the northern line, with lots of cafes and restaurants nearby. The walk up the stairs with luggage was a challenge, so beware if you're not up for that! Hannah was a great communicator and made check in really simple."
13035561,89466210,2016-07-28,55275301,Emily,The apartment was in perfect condition and was very homely. We were met by the cleaner who was extremely helpful also. A beautiful little apartment with heaps of light. Be ready to climb the steps to it though!

13035561,95943129,2016-08-21,32414628,Jodie,"Hannah's apartment was super lovely and bright. It was 10 minutes from London Euston and only a few tube stops away from Camden. The apartment itself was absolutely beautiful, bright open rooms with wooden floors, super comfy double bed and a shower/bath. The flat was clean and Hannah's cleaner, Lawrencia, met us outside the flat with the keys. Hannah has kept me right with travel queries etc and I would 100% book her home if we came back to London. Flats next to loads of fresh fruit and veg shops and there's a vegetarian restraunt next to the flat which is perfect if you're veggie like us! 10/10. Not a bad thing to say! "

13035561,99455782,2016-09-04,58382560,Finn,"My friend and I stayed in Hannah`s beautiful apartment for 4 nights. We arrived after a long flight and once we had tackled the stairs with our suitcases we were in complete bliss. Her place was very clean, light filled and comfortable. We really enjoyed the area, there is great pizza, fruit shop and Japanese nearby. The tube is also very close and it was easier to get into central London than we expected however we explored the area mostly because it is so pretty and relaxed with nice parks and interesting buildings all around the apartment. I would definitely book again and recommend to visiting friends :) Thank you Hannah! "
13035561,99910201,2016-09-06,2590959,Sol,Hannah was very good with communication and her place was super cozy and clean. She even had some of my favorite books on her bookshelf so I know I would get along with her. Would definitely come back. 
13035561,102542958,2016-09-18,1212626,Sarah,"We had a great weekend staying at Hannah's, it's really reasonably priced for such a lovely apartment. It felt very Scandinavian in style it was so light, airy and really well designed, loved the bathroom floor tiles and white painted floorboards! Hannah was a great host and gave us tips on where to go in the area. <br/><br/>The flat is really well equipped too, the coffee machine was a treat and the memory foam mattress was amazing. We really recommend this place and wouldn't hesitate staying again! "
13035561,107280213,2016-10-09,5688035,Jenna & Diarmid,"We had an amazing stay at Hannah's apartment and it was probably one of our favourite Airbnb experiences. Everything was perfect: the apartment was homely and clean, and the location was perfect as it was only a few minutes walk from the underground. Would highly recommend for a visit to London! "
13035561,109552808,2016-10-22,64416652,Bethany,"Hannah's place was literally a dream come true! Even better in real life than the photos. We had a perfect stay and would definitely stay there again. Hannah was incredibly helpful with messaging back on directions etc. It was SO close to the tube station Archway (so handy). <br/><br/>Overall the apartment has such a unique and special feel to it from details in the architecture like arched windows and high ceilings. This paired with Hannah's modern and design conscious style, it is visually a dream. <br/><br/>Would recommend to anyone :) "
13035561,110295003,2016-10-25,79049978,Brittany,"Hannah made it very easy to communicate with us upon our arrival and she responded quickly to any of our texts/questions that we had.  She had  a welcome note with some directions, tips, and information on the flat.  We were able to use her wifi which was a big help.  Although it was quite a few floors to walk up, her apartment was exactly how it appeared on her listing and it was very comfortable.  The location of her flat made it easy for my sister and I to get into central London and explore London's main attractions.  With her flat being a quick walk to the tube, my sister and I were able to grab a coffee from the Starbucks right across from the tube and be on our way."
13035561,110713026,2016-10-28,47986837,Daisy,"I had a lovely mid week stay at Hannah's apartment! The pictures do not do it justice, such a lovely home with high ceilings and great character. Excellent location, super comfy bed and a cosy warm living room. Lawrencia met me at the beginning and end of my stay and was extremely helpful. <br/>I will definitely be returning soon!<br/><br/>Daisy and James <br/>Xx"
13035561,111179235,2016-10-30,94060151,Jenny,"Great stay at Hannah's place. Perfect location for what we wanted to do in Archway and so easy to get to the tube for everything else. Very easy to collect the keys from Hannah's cleaner on the Friday and we met Hannah on the way out to give the keys back. Lovely apartment and lots of communication from the host making the whole experience very easy and enjoyable.

He called us in advance of our arrival to check on our schedule, met us at the door upon arrival, gave us a tour of the place and even took us to the local bus stops and showed us the stores nearby.  The unit was spacious, very clean and well arranged.  It has 3 rooms, one kitchen and a full bathroom. Everything seemed well arranged and in the right place.  Very safe neighborhood.  Simon also promptly gets back to you with any questions you may have afterwards.  We sure recommend the place.  The bus-stop is only a 2-minute walk from the unit. There, you can take a 15-minute bus ride to the Richmond train station and take a train to the heart of London in 20-30 minutes; costing about than £ 4 per person (kids below 10 for free).  Buses run 24 hours/ day and trains run almost past midnight. A little bit of ride to London but not too inconvenient if you are not in a hurry.....  Overall, good experience and comfortable stay.

13463318,105794736,2016-10-02,45557912,Mike,"Really lucky to find this very spacious 3 double bed home in London for an 8 week stay, although we never met Ed or Jane they made our get-in simple and were easy to contact throughout.  <br/>The home itself is great, brand new kitchen extension with full length folding external doors opening up to the rear garden. So impressed with the induction hob that I just purchased the same model! Like the kitchen, both the bathroom and en-suite are brand new with great modern showers. <br/>Originally looking to be closer to the centre of London but to be honest you are no better off as transport options are absolutely fantastic. We were 5 mins from choice of 2 train stations with very regular trains to Charing Cross 15min via London bridge-10min, and Waterloo between. 15mins to Victoria whilst also having the option to jump on the DLR that takes 5 mins to Greenwich (a must visit area) and then on to Bank -25mins via Canary Warf- 10mins. Best of all, using the DLR for 20 mins and you are the door of London City Airport! <br/>Although on a quiet street you are only a 5 minute walk to the local gym with swimming pool and Lewisham Shopping centre -M&S, Sainsbury and best of all the street market that is set up every day.<br/><br/>Many thanks to Ed & Jane for providing a most comfortable family home in a very accessible location.<br/>"

13501065,136221795,2017-03-09,118952231,David,Great host; welcoming place. Fitzrovia is fun.
13501065,136519727,2017-03-11,2715750,Wen Bo,Giudas made an effort to accommodate my check-in time. The room was superb and the location was central. I definitely recommend!
13501065,139698688,2017-03-26,79961047,Sofieke,"Perfect location, nice house, good bed, kitchen, bathroom and hospitable host. You share the house with Giudas and another Airbnb person. It was quiet inside the house, I really liked that sice I was there for work. If you don't need a desk, I would definitely recommend this place for work or holiday!"
13501065,140657208,2017-03-31,115057472,Mark,"This was my first airbnb and I wasn't disappointed. Giudas' place is perfect. Very clean, great location, and Giudas is a great host. I thoroughly recommend this place. "
13501065,142219089,2017-04-07,6208093,Thibaut,"The apartment is nice, comfortable, well located, and it is kept absolutely clean. <br/>Giudas is a perfect host: welcoming, helpful and easy going.<br/>My stay here was just excellent.<br/>"
13501065,142515164,2017-04-08,30733089,Jason,"Giudas's place is a really nice little apartment with everything you need and beautifully decorated. Small but very comfortable and cosy. It's in a quiet street but is just a very short walk away from the bustling heart of the city. Didn't need to take the tube anywhere, just walked from the house. Giudas was also very friendly and welcoming. Would definitely recommend and will try to stay there again next time I'm passing through London."
13501065,144312447,2017-04-15,11558011,Jonas,Everything was great. Great attention paid to details. Highly recommend it. Guidas is a great host very mindful and friendly. Thank you.

He even gave us of his own food when we arrived too late buy some evening snacks ourselves. The room is beautiful, clean and quiet. I would stay here again! "
13501065,149639128,2017-05-05,30733089,Jason,"I stayed here a couple weeks ago, and just as before everything was perfect. Wonderful decoration in the apartment. A cosy place to stay and very clean and tidy, and in a super convenient location that's just a very short walk to the centre of London. Fantastic place!"
13501065,150477857,2017-05-08,11023373,Nadia,"Giudas' home was lovely and well kept. Close to Oxford Circus so easy to get to and from all the places we wanted to go. Though the room was a bit cramped for two of us, we didn't mind as we were out of the house most of the day. Thanks for a great stay Giudas!"
13501065,151912581,2017-05-14,18716260,Michael,Guidas is a very nice host. The room was very nice and exactly how it is described. I had a great stay and can recommend it to everybody. 
13501065,152741097,2017-05-18,32071808,Stephen,I have stayed with Giudas before and his place is always very clean and he is always very helpful 
13501065,153854258,2017-05-22,115889758,Anne-Charlotte,Beautiful and well-located appartement. Guidas is really kind and care about your well-being! 
13501065,157068497,2017-06-02,33367147,怡,這是一間在一樓的分租套房交通十分便利，離牛津街十分近，附近有很多餐廳<br/>當天中午房東就特別從工作的地方回來讓我CHECK IN了非常感謝<br/>房東是從事室內設計相關工作，房間及照片都處理的不錯，雖然非常忙碌但還是十分細心，屋內很乾淨，也會有乾淨的毛巾提供使用，床很軟但意外的十分舒服，5月底去天氣很好所以被子稍厚了點<br/>如果入住有幾點要注意會更完美<br/>1.公寓的旁邊再進行施工所以8點左右會有施工的聲音，將窗戶關上會好些<br/>2.屋主還有另一間客房出租所以晚上要保持安靜不要打擾到屋主和其他房客，<br/>浴室的使用也要小心保持乾燥和乾淨<br/>3.因為顧及同住的房客房東的安全，關門時一定要確實關上。
13501065,158793668,2017-06-08,73469095,Kelly,公寓在市中心，非常方便~
13501065,159540287,2017-06-11,14333722,Esther,"I enjoyed every second of my stay at Guidas 's place. First of all, he is the sweetest host. He quickly answered all of my questions ahead of the trip, and made me feel very welcome. His place was absolutely perfect: beautifuly decored, comfy (the bed is amazing) and convenient. The apartment is very well located, two stations away from St Pancras, and a few minutes from Soho, but the street is very calm, so it is nice to go back home late in the evening in a quiet street. Thanks Guidas, you're the best! "
13501065,160937084,2017-06-16,129333925,Steve,"You couldn't ask for a better location to visit London.  We got up the first morning, walked to Buckingham Palace, and watched the Queen leave for the day.  The underground is only a few short blocks away, connecting you to everything.<br/><br/>Sure the place is small, but it's not a problem for those wishing to visit London rather than lying about all day.  Guidas is kind, giving you your own space and offers ideas if asked.<br/><br/>Couldn't be better for us."
13501065,161636333,2017-06-18,9100450,Alma,"The room and the entire place is beautifully decorated and spotless. the area is extremely accessible and central. <br/>we were a bit disappointed that nothing was said about the construction work going on right outside the room window, making some noise in the morning. but other than that, our stay was wonderful and we recommend this place with great pleasure. "
13501065,162701100,2017-06-22,17040724,Keith Arthur,"Excellent location for walking in Fitzrovia, access to restaurants, the British Museum and Regent's Park. At least an hour and fifteen minutes by Uber from the airport. The place is very clean, updated and feels fresh. The wifi is pretty good; a little slow at uploading pics. Although there is a shared kitchen (very small), there is no place to sit and eat, other than your bed. If you plan just to sleep here, it should be fine. If you want a place to take a break from tourist activities while you read or have a beer, the lack of seating means your only option is the (comfortable) bed. Guidas provided us with a portable fan which we put in the open window and it cooled off the room and muffled construction noise from outside. "
13501065,165219245,2017-06-30,15063040,Nadina,"Giudas was helpful in letting me drop my bags early but when I rang the wrong it was an awkward start. Lucky the same thing happened with the same neighbour later in the week, so it happens. <br/>The room is lovely and just as the pictures. The bathroom & kitchen also nicely decorated. Everything you may need while traveling like iron & hairdryer all available. The location of the apartment is really convenient. It's close to a tube station but really easy to walk most places as well. <br/>This was the first time I have had a shared apartment but with everyone's schedule I really didn't cross paths with the host or the guest in the other room. Giudas allowed great privacy which is ideal for this situation. Sticking to you room to start was strange but this was really just a base to sleep and most times I was out and for this the room was perfect. Like check in check out was also very easy and whilst I left in the morning I did have a flexible arrangement if needed. All this was much appreciated. "
13501065,168777811,2017-07-10,136523552,Chris,"The place is absolutely amazing. It's right at the heart of central London. It's clean, tidy and neat. Most importantly, Giudas is a wonderful host who is very helpful in all aspects!"
13501065,169706432,2017-07-13,32071808,Stephen,I have stayed with Giudas before and have always been really happy with the experience. The room is really clean and quiet being at the back of the flat away from the street. Giudas is always helpful and relaxed.... 
13501065,171982547,2017-07-19,2120319,Lonnie,"Giudas's apartment is in the perfect location to explore London. We ended up walking most of the time instead of taking the tube because the surrounding neighborhoods are so fun to explore on foot. That saved us a lot of transportation money too! <br/><br/>The apartment is very clean and looks exactly as pictured. In fact, there was more space in the room than I expected. We were quite comfortable since we unpacked our suitcase and put our clothes in the dresser provided and stored away our luggage. <br/><br/>Giudas is also very kind and he was very helpful and communicative with us when our AirBnb host cancelled on us at the last minute. I would highly recommend a stay here!"
13501065,177654207,2017-08-03,137341511,Joanne,Guidascwas the perfect host. Loved my stay

His flat is really nice and styley decorated and my room was small, but very nice and the bed is sooo comfy. Everything is very clean and Guidas is such a nice host. He gave me a lot of good tipps and so I had a wonderful stay. I will definitely come back if I stay in London again. Thanks Guidas "

Very clean, stylish and very close to the city centre - an easy & short walk to Oxford Street. And Giudas is very friendly and accommodating. Thanks for the great stay! - Jason."

13501065,237028380,2018-02-21,20603535,Faisal,Guidas is a very considerate and accommodating host; he offered fresh towels gave me an electric adapter to use and has a good energy about him. The room  itself if very comfortable and the common areas are very well kept. The only minor inconvenience I had is that the bathroom layout is somewhat challenging if you’re over 190 cm. Would stay here again if in London.
13501065,240197635,2018-03-04,127452112,Junjie,"Giudas is a great host, friendly and warm-hearted. The room is stylish and tidy. The check-in instruction is detailed and clear. The location is fantastic, walkable to Oxford Circus, Euston, King’s Cross or UCL!"

13501065,247951891,2018-03-30,539584,Fred,"I stayed in the rear facing room, which was very quiet, and has a super comfy bed. I cooked breakfast a few days, and made coffee in his small but lovely  kitchen.  The café on the corner is wonderful!"

13501065,262299873,2018-05-08,16007081,Joey,"Had a great time at Giudas' place. It is very central to many of London's best attractions. Fitzrovia is a lovely neighborhood with many great choices for food and coffee, or a local pub. His place is stunning and very stylish and was immaculate. I would definitely stay there again."

Closest tube station is Oxford Circus, walking distance to Oxford St, Regent Park and Covent Garden. Lots of brilliant shopping around this area, brilliant culture and great places to eat. I found it to be very safe and the room was quiet. Would highly recommend!"
13501065,276325607,2018-06-13,186975863,Joshua,"A beautiful flat in a great part of town. Lovely large sunny room, close to theatres, shops and tube stations. Giudas is a friendly host, quick to respond to questions. I plan to stay here again."

13501065,284866820,2018-07-02,2830046,Kelsey,"This is a great place!  Perfect location!  I am a single woman traveling by myself and I felt very comfortable walking around both day and night.  It is close to lots of fun restaurants and bars.  The apartment is very clean and nice.  Super easy check in from a lock box so there was no stress of coordinating timing. Everything is arranged very professionally (towels, etc).  Guidas was out of town so I didn't meet him.  The only thing I didn't realize that there is another room in the apartment that Guidas also rents for Airbnb (I didn't read the description carefully enough I guess).  I never ran into the other Airbnb person, but as a single woman it made my slightly uncomfortable to know there was another man coming and going from the apartment (shared bathroom) that I knew nothing about.  Only something relevant if you are a nervous single traveler -- you may want to ask first about another possible guest.  Otherwise a fabulous place and highly recommended!"
13501065,289869556,2018-07-13,63920194,Bradley,"My stay at Giudas’ place was fantastic. I was in town on a combination personal/work trip. The location is perfect because it is close to everything you need - multiple tube stations, great restaurants, etc. - but is tucked away on a quiet street so it is not loud like the busy areas. <br/><br/>The apartment is very clean and well decorated. The bed is very comfy - I slept great. Giudas is very kind and welcoming. I come to London often and will look for his place in future visits. I would absolutely recommend his place!"
13501065,297109587,2018-07-27,197881947,Jonathan,The place was clean and the location was very convenient! Definitely recommend it to anyone who’s staying in London.

13501065,306917263,2018-08-13,66537171,Josie,I had a great stay at Giudas apartment. The location was perfect  close to public transport and easy walking distance from all the main attractions. <br/>The apartment itself was sparkling clean and the bed was really comfortable. <br/>Check in was easy. I would stay again. 
13501065,308279483,2018-08-16,130747689,Taylor,"Had a great stay at this apartment! The flat itself is quite small, but perfect for on the go travelers who are just looking for a place to crash at night. Location is absolutely fabulous and check-in was extremely easy. "
13501065,318091342,2018-09-03,60098025,Carolin,Beautiful appartment in an even better location. Giudas is super good with replying to messages and was very accomodating considering my rather early check-in. Would definitely recommend and stay here again.
13501065,321490903,2018-09-10,45141232,Naomi,"Giudas is very professional and responsive. Check in and out was easy and the location was excellent. The bed was also large and comfortable, in a quiet street, so sleep was not a problem."
13501065,322835691,2018-09-14,50189414,Holly,"Giudas place is super convenient and in a great neighbourhood. It is also stylish and clean. Note that washer dryer is not included, however. Good for a short trip in London."
13501065,325659728,2018-09-20,74276364,Carissa,"Staying at Giudas' home was one of the best decisions I made for my trip to London. It's exactly what I hope for in an Airbnb: easygoing, super clean and comfortable, good privacy. I consider myself very lucky that I was able to stay here – and I stayed for almost a week. No regrets! I looked forward to coming home to the flat after each day I was out, given how well-kept, beautifully designed the home is. And yes, the bed is as comfy as it looks!<br/><br/>One of the best parts is also the area. Fitzrovia is quite posh and there are loads of amazing restaurants, cafes, even boutique studios and shops around. Not to mention everything is so accessible including major museums and parks just by walking (mostly lasting 15 minutes max). When I travel these are the stuff I love, so it was perfect. <br/><br/>Giudas is also a great host. He is easygoing, very friendly & considerate! Glad I got to meet him a few times :) I also had a few interactions with other guests with no trouble.<br/><br/>Of course I'd definitely stay here again. To give more perspective, I consider the flat itself far superior to a hotel room of similar rate (which I did during part of my trip as a solo traveler). I admit I did have difficulty with the key at first, so just make sure you really turn it all the way, haha. Thank you again, Giudas!"
13501065,328887410,2018-09-27,95863683,Spencer,"This spot was so great! The location was amazing, it is on a very cute and posh street next to some good cafes and bars. It is also only a 10 minute walk to some great shopping and even more bars and restaurants/tube stop. The space was exactly as described. Giudas gave very clear instructions on how to check in and was quick to communicate with us. Highly recommended for couples or singles coming to London."
13501065,335162502,2018-10-11,9643758,Emily,"Giudas was a fantastic host. The location is perfect, everything is super easy and straightforward. Not lots of space but perfect for busy trips to London."

13501065,351289003,2018-11-22,109901078,Adrian,"Giudas was very accommodating,( I was able to check in at 10am) informative and always replied quickly.  The entire apartment was clean, the shower gets super hot (the towel warmer is a nice touch) and the location is about 5 mins away from Oxford street & all of the shops.  Being 6'4, I had no problem with the bathroom size and the bed was comfy with a warm, thick comforter."
13501065,355515686,2018-12-04,212592316,Katharine,Giudas's home was very stylish and clean and just a short walk from Oxford Circus. He was very easy to communicate with and was very accommodating.

13501065,358384281,2018-12-14,14817675,Christine,"This place is beautiful!! Lovely decor. Such a great location - quiet street but just minutes on foot to big shopping and tube stations. Great coffee around the corner at Kaffeine. There is no common room but since there is another guest in the apartment besides the host, this is fine. The bathroom is nice and I slept SO well on the comfy bed. Only problem was check in - the keys weren’t where they were supposed to be. I went across the street to the pub to wait for the keys which took an hour, but it gave me time to get to know the other Airbnb guest which turned out to be a new friend! So anyway, no big deal, just a bit of an inconvenience. I would totally recommend this place and would stay again in the future."
13501065,361388135,2018-12-23,50179259,Goryacheva,"It is a great place, very clean and perfect location."

13501065,423522464,2019-03-14,150355922,Ismael,"Cozy flat in a great location, close to all London atractions amd a lot of restaurants and pubs in a short walk distance. I enjoyed my stay I definitely will stay at Giudas place again. Highly recommend."

13501065,431034019,2019-03-31,29249961,Patrick,Perfect location. Easy access to nearby Tubes. Guidas was super fast in responding to questions. Comfy bed. Very happy!
13501065,435060385,2019-04-09,1571614,Danny,"Fantastic location, clean and stylish rooms. Would definitely suit someone wanting to sample London’s nightlife. I was visiting for business, and it worked great for me too."
13501065,439523138,2019-04-19,92620953,Carolyn,My room was VERY quiet in spite of the green man pub across the street. The location is very centrally located too. Be aware the goodge street station is not open to board a train in the mornings. You can exit the trains anytime.  The  pillows were wonderful and the bed comfy. I enjoyed my stay very much!!
13501065,443655716,2019-04-26,6305061,Andalucia,Great place. Neighborhood is chic and safe. Giudas place is very clean.
13501065,448365989,2019-05-05,221354029,Michael,"This stylish and clean flat is located in the heart of Fitzrovia.  Guidas' place is a 5-to-10-minute walk to the Oxford Circus Underground station.  Goodge Street station is also nearby, as are city buses.  There are lots of excellent restaurants and pubs in the neighborhood.  I always felt safe walking in the area, even at night.  Guidas' street has a surprisingly residential feel to it, even though there are businesses nearby.  The flat is small, with no common area to hang out.  But it was big enough for my needs and the room itself has a nice big bed with plenty of closet and bureau space for clothes.  Guidas was the perfect host: accessible when you needed him and friendly without being overbearing.  I enjoyed my week-long stay in his flat and would gladly return."
13501065,451228762,2019-05-11,5375333,Ryan,"Outstanding place, close to the tube. Sparkling clean apartment, comfortable bed, plenty of linens and supplies. Giudas made the check in process super easy with a lock box and screen shots of where to find everything. He responds very quickly, and checks in to make sure your stay and holiday are are going well. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in London!!"
13501065,454036734,2019-05-17,45831083,Girish,"Giudas's place is immaculately clean and wonderfully located. He was always quick to reach, and was very helpful in his communications. Highly recommended!"
13501065,458665897,2019-05-26,164360438,Carolyn,"This property is sparkling clean, and the bed is oh so comfortable after a long day exploring London. It was a pleasure to stay in this quiet corner of London."
13501065,463426203,2019-06-03,21178513,Ron Richard,"It was located in a lovely neighbourhood, quiet but still quite close to the center. The place was exactly like the pictures shown on the page. Overall, I enjoyed the place and my stay. Would definitely consider booking again when I visit London next time! Thank you, Guidas!"
13501065,474736603,2019-06-23,10153353,Daniel,"I felt extremely comfortable at Giudas’ place. Even though you share the space, I felt at ease the entire time. I was able to use the kitchen and bathroom without any hassle. The room was also the right size for myself. The place is also perfectly located to so many of the must-sees in London. I enjoyed my stay immensely."
13501065,481711139,2019-07-05,104762506,Stella,"The location is very good. Fitzrovia has lots of cafe, pub, restaurent, and very convenient. The room is very quiet. If you’re woman, please prepare girls shampoo and bodyshower since there are only for men’s in the bathroom. Flat is small but very well organized, and the puppy OSCAR was kind and cute."
13501065,497212026,2019-07-28,25304733,Sofía,Giudas is the best host I’ve ever stay with.<br/>His place is amazing and I love everything.<br/>He made it feel a home away from home.<br/>Really recommend this place. 10/10
13501065,503042636,2019-08-05,153471078,Swee,Great place would stay again.
13501065,507258369,2019-08-11,14075375,David,"A great location, a wonderful host, and all the comforts of home. No surprise why this host has such a high rating on here.<br/><br/>I would stay here again without hesitation."
13501065,510002383,2019-08-15,135814871,Lukas,Cleanest Airbnb I've found so far in this area. Nice host. Easy communication. Perfect fit for my needs
13501065,517351667,2019-08-25,14333722,Esther,"It's my second stay at Giudas's and I love everything about his place.

13501065,547934076,2019-10-16,3190597,Paul,"What a great location! You step out the door and are greeted by the sights and sounds of London for a fraction of the cost of any of the 5-star hotels just blocks away. Located on a sleepy side street across from a quiet pub, this place little apartment shines when it comes to fit and finish.  Great bed and a tidy and clean bathroom. I will be staying here again."
13557685,84257860,2016-07-06,14875211,Mathilde,"Excellent séjour chez Pascale ! La chambre est confortable et l'appartement est très bien situé, proche du métro et des bus permettant d'aller dans le centre de Londres en 15 minutes. Pascale est très accueillante !

13557685,85367500,2016-07-11,62396764,Chandan,"Pascale was v welcoming, provided us with towels/toiletries and there was milk in the fridge for tea etc even though she was going away. the room itself is cosy for two but not a problem as the living room is nice and big "

13587755,222975919,2017-12-31,110178762,Christopher,"Excellent location, perfect house to get in and out of London and if you know the tube systems it’s great upper and underground only 6 minute walk to each. Could not have asked for a better stay over Christmas"
13642752,85024479,2016-07-10,10956800,Iza,"Georgie was an awesome and kind host. The place has anything you could possibly need (iron and board, coffee, etc). Really nice room and comfortable bedding! I stayed just one night, but it was great. I really recommend and would stay here again<br/>Another perk is that it is a short walk from the tube! close to a general store.<br/>Also very close to heathrow. I used an uber to the airport because it was so close. 10-15 min away from airport"
13642752,95790103,2016-08-21,87299634,Nils,"Great experience. Stayed for 12 days, and have zero complaints. The room did not disappoint, and Georgie is a great host. Would definitely recommend it!"

13642752,121458909,2016-12-17,84545083,Adriana,"Georgie is an incredibly friendly host. I got along very well with her. She is a very solar person and extremely willing to help you out when you ask for something. The place is exactly as shown in the pictures, extremely cozy and clean. The area is lovely, chiswick high road is full of shops and you can find everything you need. There is also a gym really close to the place if you like going to ! I really suggest you staying at Georgie's place. Five stars experience :)<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
13642752,129892112,2017-02-03,58907636,Ryan,"A great stay, would defiantly recommend."
13642752,130905426,2017-02-09,95139943,Chris,Great location and a lovely room. Enjoyed meeting Georgie who was a great host. Quite residential street near tube and Chiswick Park. 
13642752,132339036,2017-02-17,95139943,Chris,Great location and a very peaceful room in a lovely house. Will go back 
13642752,136541487,2017-03-11,58957071,Ekaterina,"Everything was perfect! Spacious beautiful bedroom with private en-suite bathroom and very comfortable bedding. Georgie was very welcoming, friendly and helpful.<br/>The place had anything you could possibly need (washing machine, dryer, iron, board). It was handy to have access to the kitchen and fridge.<br/>The house is close to a tube station and bus stop. Chiswick is a very pleasant neighbourhood packed with trendy cafes and shops. We would definitely stay at Georgie's place again and would recommend to anyone travelling to London for a visit."
13642752,137548510,2017-03-16,3607692,Julien,"On a business trip to the Chiswick Park, none of my usual hotels were available, so I gave AirBnb a try. Georgie's place is very well located: next to the metro station and walking distance to my office in the park.<br/><br/>I knew I'd come in late. Georgie arranged for a late check-in, which was very much appreciated after a long travel.<br/><br/>The place is very clean and functional. The bed was very comfortable. The private bathroom is on the small side, but nothing that prevents normal functions.<br/><br/>I only stayed for the night, arriving late and leaving early, so I didn't get a chance to benefit from the other amenities like the kitchen and the garden. This would be very convenient for a couple staying for a couple days and don't want to spend too much on restaurants. I'll be sure to allow for more time when I come back."
13642752,140904091,2017-04-01,25192142,Андрей,Great location! Great host! super close to Chiswick park.

13642752,148801989,2017-05-01,127878385,Jayson,Good place for the price. Tube station about a three minute walk. Takes about 20-25 minutes to get to Central London via tube but about 45 minutes to heathrow despite being on the west side of town. Would stay there again. 
13642752,155683462,2017-05-28,131503136,Natalie,"Lovely, comfortable room - didn't meet Georgie but she was very helpful in communications up to our stay. <br/>The only issue is the toilet flush which Georgie did bring to our attention but this doesn't seem to work at all! <br/>Location was spot on. "
13642752,164992302,2017-06-30,53183423,Sadhbh,"Comfortable and spotlessly clean room, pleasant and accommodating host (I arrived later than planned). Nice location in a quiet street very close to the District line, Turnham Green, Chiswick High Road and Kew Gardens are also nearby. "
13642752,168465160,2017-07-09,95416828,Jay,"I stayed extended my stay as Georgie had some last minute availability and I need to stay longer in London for work.<br/><br/>As per previous review, Georgie is a great host and its clear why she has Super Host status.<br/><br/>The place is great, clean and tidy with a really quaint charm about it.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

I felt very welcome and was able to fully relax. The location is great with loads of restaurants and cafes very close."
13642752,174117613,2017-07-24,95416828,Jay,"I have stayed with Georgie several times, as it's close to the office in Chiswick Park and very good for transport links to central London / Heathrow.<br/><br/>This time I had to cancel as I was required to stay in the US at home for an extra week. However I had advised Georgie this might of been the case and she was flexible in letting me cancel. I will be return in a week though.<br/><br/>Don't miss out on this amazing house and friendly host!"
13642752,186776238,2017-08-25,95416828,Jay,"Have stayed with Georgie several times now, due to the location as it's great for Chiswick Business Park and links to central.<br/><br/>Always a clean, tidy place with a great host who is also happy to assist."

13642752,201411912,2017-10-08,148131331,Takeshi,ﾁｼﾞｯｸﾊｲﾛｰﾄﾞ沿いにあり､ﾊﾞｽ停まで30秒位でとても便利な立地です。隣にはｸﾚｲﾄﾝﾎﾃﾙがあるので､外食も気軽に楽しめます。閑静な住宅街にあり､Georgie の家にも素敵な庭があります。私は地下のﾍﾞｯﾄﾞﾙｰﾑを使わせて頂きました。地下ですが､窓があるため部屋は明るいです。<br/>この部屋には､ﾄｲﾚとｼｬﾜｰがついているので､快適でした。ｷｯﾁﾝとﾀﾞｲﾆﾝｸﾞﾃｰﾌﾞﾙは共同のため､ｷｯﾁﾝをより清潔かつ快適に使うためのﾊｳｽﾙｰﾙがあります。このﾙｰﾙを理解できる英語力が無いと泊めてもらないかもしれません。<br/>ﾀﾞｲﾆﾝｸﾞﾃｰﾌﾞﾙの上は､ｶﾞﾗｽ張りになっているので､空を眺めながらの食事は､最高でした。
13642752,206590864,2017-10-26,44414865,Mark,"very accommodating -at short notice - a comfortable, pleasant stay as ever - thanks Georgie"

13642752,238623921,2018-02-26,129408598,Francesco,Georgie è stata molto ospitale e gentile. La casa era pulita e accogliente; perfetta se si deve alloggiare da soli o in coppia per visitare Chiswick. Il quartiere era tranquillo e la casa comoda ai mezzi di trasporto pubblici.
13642752,239319676,2018-03-01,162269356,Karen,"Beautiful property with everything you could  possibly need.  Excellent transport links.   Thoughtful, friendly host.   Highly recommended"

Additional blankets for colder nights. <br/>Great location for Chiswick Business Park or tube. Coffee shop and laundry across the street. Only 3 bus stops away from great High Road restaurants and pubs."
13642752,247390906,2018-03-28,162269356,Karen,As perfect as always

13642752,272198683,2018-06-03,32738720,Erik,"My three weeks at Georgie's can only be described in the most glowing terms possible. Her house was conveniently located for my daily work at The National Archives in Kew, which was only a 20-minute walk away. The nearby public transport connections ensure that you can easily get anywhere else in the London area as well. The room itself was clean, spacious, and pleasantly cool (it was 20+ degrees outside for most of my stay), with a great en-suite bathroom attached. Foremost, however, is that Georgie is an incredibly accommodating and very welcoming host. I, for one, could not have wished for a better place to stay during my three weeks in London.    "
13642752,273832997,2018-06-07,166536253,Howard,Georgie’s place was brilliant and just as advertised. Super convenient for the business park the room was all that anyone could wish for.
13642752,282846118,2018-06-28,29085301,Alison,"My new favourite place to stay on my work trips to London. <br/>Georgie’s place is comfortable, clean and stylish, and the room feels very private being downstairs away from the main areas.  <br/>The bedroom is large with a very comfortable bed, and has french doors which can be opened for fresh air whilst still being secure behind security gates.  The ensuite is sparkling clean with good shower pressure.<br/>I couldn’t fault the hospitality."
13642752,284324867,2018-07-01,141925467,Bowen,"Excellent host! I booked very last minute for my trip and Georgie responded very promptly. Fantastic hospitality. The place was really nice, and the commute to the city centre is very convenient."
13642752,288628807,2018-07-10,47246231,Andrzej,"A great place to stay at, friendly host, nicely decorated room (and the whole flat). The location is very convenient as well - close to the tube station and walking distance to Chiswick High Street."

Fantastic with communication and information in advance of our stay and then super welcoming of us into her home once we arrived. <br/>We were attending an event at Gunnersbury Park and this location was ideal - walking distance to venue, just off Chiswick High Street for breakfast and drinks and just a short tube ride away from the city centre. <br/>Would certainly recommend - big thumbs up "

13642752,315663427,2018-08-29,171615163,David,Georgie was a welcoming host. The room was spacious and well furnished. The location provides easy access to nearby District Line Tube station and is a short walk from the many eating and shopping options along Chiswick High Road.
13642752,319805515,2018-09-07,29085301,Alison,"As always a lovely experience staying at Georgie's place.  The room is large, clean and beautifully set up with comfortable bed and nice linen and the bathroom is always sparkling clean with a small but good shower. <br/>The location is great, a short and easy walk to the tube (which also has a newish great daytime cafe next to it), and within 10-15 mins flat walk to nice restaurants."

During initial communications, she was responsive, willing to work with us, and answered all the questions honestly and quickly. We booked it just 2 days before arriving, and she made it easy and smooth! Ivana's apartment is approximately an 8 minute walk from Clapham Junction, and was a fun walk as the apartment is located in a great area in Battersea with shopping, yummy restaurants, bars open late and plenty to see and do if you do not want to trek all the way to Central (20-25 mins by train). <br/><br/>At arrival and check-in, Ivana was kind, and offered us both slippers for the house which was a nice touch! She showed us around the house, and everything was clean and immaculate. Another guest was just leaving, so she let us keep our stuff in the apartment in the morning which was helpful! She provided two sets of towels and a hair-dryer in the room. The bed was SO comfortable, and the apartment was kept at a great temperature throughout the day and night. We left early, and came in late due to our schedule, but Ivana never complained, and always greeted us with a smile! It was our pleasure to meet her and be invited into her home. An extra plus was the great vegetarian breakfast, and Ivana even made us these amazing Clementine, Ginger, Apple (and a few other things) in smoothie form which was delicious! There were fruits, toasts, a multitude of jams, granola, yogurt, and biscuits and coffee/tea! A perfectly healthy and appropriate breakfast. Thank you Ivana for a wonderful stay and we would recommend her as a host for anyone!"

13745959,132530318,2017-02-18,21775853,Nicolas,Great place !! Thanks 
13745959,133273206,2017-02-21,20004873,Dave,Ivana's place was wonderful and Ivana was extremely helpful and communicative around how to get to the place and what was available to do in the area. The neighborhood (near Battersea) is in a great place and has a lot of stuff to do itself. Definitely recommended as a place where you can explore the city!
13745959,135123245,2017-03-03,10348434,Eva,"Highly recommended!! Ivana's home is really peaceful and charming. Also it's really tidy and clean.

13745959,135569554,2017-03-05,60697796,Thierry,"Aucune hésitation à avoir concernant le logement, la situation géographique par rapport au centre ville, l’aéroport de Gatwick.<br/>Et surtout pour la prestation d'Ivana qui est d'une extrême gentillesse ainsi que d'une discrétion absolue toujours prête à rendre le moindre service.<br/>Son appartement est tout à fait charmant et d'une propreté exceptionnel. Les adjectifs me manquent pour décrire toutes les qualités du lieu et de sont hôte.<br/>Encore un grand merci pour ce séjour :))  "
13745959,136841469,2017-03-12,28503522,Trevor,"Ivanka is a great host. The room has a really comfortable bed in a clean and recently updated flat. <br/><br/>The only downside is for less mobile people, there is a lot of walking to get to the nearest train station. If you are fit and don't mind a 10 minute walk the train station gets you anywhere fast. <br/><br/>The neighbourhood is full of pubs and local bars. The restaurants in the area have decent prices and great food. "
13745959,137418878,2017-03-15,2403845,Patrick,A wonderful central location with lovely cafes and shops nearby. I felt safe and comfortable staying at Ivana's place even though I was travelling alone.

Sie war eine total hilfsbereite und angenehme Gastgeberin. Die Wohnung war super sauber und total gemütlich eingerichtet. Auch das Frühstück war rund um gut und sehr gesund! Wir können es wirklich nur jedem wärmstens empfehlen bei Ivana zu wohnen es gab wirklich nichts auszusetzen :)
13745959,140511405,2017-03-30,15700209,Liting,Great place to stay in London! The hosts are pretty nice and thoughtful! They will prepare you a nice selection of healthy breakfast.

13745959,141138390,2017-04-02,33544335,Alexander,"Simple, very clean, homely apartment in a great location.  Walking distance to shops, bars around Clapham Junction and only a train away from the South Bank and Shoreditch areas.<br/><br/>Ivana and Peter were helpful and very flexible with the check in time, bonus of having the breakfast provided was really appreciated."
13745959,145162893,2017-04-17,4426119,Béatrice,"Logement certes excentré mais bien desservi par les transports publics. (bus 49 et 345 ) vous déposent en 20 minutes  à la station de South Kensington. Le quartier est sympa, vivant et animé : boutiques, restaurants, pubs... et pas très éloigné du magnifique ""Battersea Park"" la chambre est simple, le lit très comfortable. J'ai été chaleureusement accueillie par Peter."

13745959,150832677,2017-05-09,110566011,Anatoli,"Erittäin siisti ja kohtuuhintainen asunto hyvällä sijainnilla. Vieraanvarainen majoittaja jonka kanssa asioiden sopiminen oli mutkatonta ja kaikki sovittu piti. Kohtuullisen kävelymatkan päässä hyvistä julkisista yhteyksistä Lontoon keskustaan. Toisaalta myös alue missä asunto sijaitsee on erittäin miellyttävä ja viikonloppuisin myös menevä. Asunto on pääkadun varrella, eli jos olet vahvasti allerginen metelille niin kannattaa vielä harkita. "
13745959,151172774,2017-05-11,53593867,Louise,"Ivana is a lovely host – she is attentive without being obtrusive. The place is immaculate, quiet and tastefully decorated. Highly recommended!"

Since I've written all the great things about the place and Ivana in a previous review, I'll just add this extra one for now: the bed is incredibly comfortable and I was able to sleep extremely well! "

É muito limpo, tudo organizado, perto da zona turística de Londres, com estação de trem na região. A rua é bastante movimentada, com restaurantes, pubs e lojas. A Ivana nos deixa à vontade e está sempre à disposição para orientações. Minha esposa admirou a delicadeza da hospedagem, com orquídeas, biscoitos e uma energia positiva que fazia toda a diferença. A Ivana é muito gentil e atenciosa, uma perfeita anfitriã. Voltaremos um dia e recomendamos demais. "

She is just a nice and kind person that makes you feel welcomed. The neighborhood is nice lively with many good restaurants and bars. The room is a small space and the bed is taking most of the room and shouldn't be advertise as a Luxury Room as it is not Luxury by any standard

13745959,167061610,2017-07-05,20473668,Elizabeth,Everything was perfect except one thing but it wasn't Ivana's fault. They didn't have a fan or air conditioning which is very typical in London since it doesn't really get hot. It was very hard for me to sleep because of the heat but im a spoiled American who lives with air conditioning. Everything else was perfect. Ivana is so sweet and helpful! Great stay and great value.
13745959,167612336,2017-07-07,80111302,Echo,Everything was great. Extremely clean and Ivana made us feel very comfortable.

Your location was perfect for touring London."

An excellent selection of breakfast is provided (fruit, myself, toast etc). All facilities are immaculate. Ivana made me feel welcome and comfortable immediately.

Si su llegada es por el aeropuerto de Gatwick hay trenes directos a la estación para llegar al apartamento. El Apartamento no es limpio sino impecable. Ivana es una persona muy agradable y educada, desafortunadamente no tuve el tiempo de conversar con su esposo, espero hacerlo en otra ocasión. Definitivamente al regresar a Londres mi primera opción seria este apartamento."

She even has breakfast prepared for you in the morning, which is very thoughtful of her! It is very suitable for couples and/or individual travelers. The neighborhood is filled with wonderful cafes, restaurants, bars, supermarkets, etc. <br/><br/>If there is one thing that could be improved, it would be the ventilation in the guest room."
13745959,201509486,2017-10-08,86956490,威,"So very well organized apartment, we are so much impressed!

To keep the flat tidy Ivana has a ""shoe free"" rule and to make me feel right at home she immediately offered me slippers and tea. Everything was immaculate and she had everything I needed: toiletries, hairdryer, internet, tea, and breakfast was included too. She even had a stack of guidebooks and tourist information in the room. I had a super early train to catch from Clapham junction in the morning and it was less than 10 minute walk, which was incredibly convenient. I would definitely stay here again."

13745959,265727701,2018-05-18,35620200,Daniel,"A Ivana foi uma excelente anfitriã, muito atenciosa e sempre preocupada em nos ajudar. Ela disponibilizou café da manhã e lanches para quando tivéssemos vontade. O quarto e o banheiro são extremamente limpos e confortáveis. <br/>O único ponto de atenção é que eles disponibilizam um quarto da casa em que moram, isso nos fez ter menos liberdade para tomar banho, comer e dormir a qualquer horário, pois tínhamos receio de incomodá-los, pois a casa é bem silenciosa. De qualquer forma ela nunca fez nenhum comentário a respeito e sempre procurou nos atender da melhor forma."

I was well rested during my first few hectic days in London because of her hospitality and the quality and cleanliness of the space. I didn’t get the chance to use the kitchen properly, but was assured that I was welcome to :) Ivana even made me a tasty spirulina smoothie on my first morning, unfortunately the only morning I managed to catch her before bolting out the door!<br/><br/>Ideal location for access to Clapham Junction on a pretty street lined with shops and smart restaurants. The bakery truck outside was an essential stop for a delicious and cheap (£1.80!) coffee every morning!<br/><br/>Would absolutely stay again. "
13745959,313513435,2018-08-25,63540049,Nicola,"What a brilliant location!  It’s easy to get to anywhere from Ivana’s place and it is surrounded by great cafes, restaurants and shops. Her home is immaculately clean and communication is easy. We have no hesitation in recommending it."

Everything is  so beautiful and spotless, there are so many thoughtful touches, and I slept wonderfully every single night. <br/><br/>Breakfast in the morning was very pleasant. Make sure you ask for coffee if you see Gael, and get chatting. If you are a milk drinker, bring some with you, as the fridge contains milk alternatives (almond milk / coconut milk). <br/><br/>Ivana and Gael are the most lovely company and you’ll find yourself chatting about the world. I felt very safe here, and incredibly looked after. Would 100% recommend, and hope to be back very soon! "

It is spotlessly clean (and I'm a bit OCD) and Ivana and her husband are just lovely people. If you are driving, my tip is to time your arrival at 4.30 and there's a good chance you can get lucky and park in Northcote road in the 1hr bay which runs 9.30 to 5.30. Ivana offered a variety of juices and teas and made me feel very welcome. Will be back for sure."
13745959,338044655,2018-10-18,189659172,Mia,"Ivana makes a peaceful athmosphere in the flat, lovely breakfast and is very helpful. Bedroom is quite small for two.  If you are a light sleeper, use ear plugs. At least during the week early in the morning  quite a lot of noise from outside and neighbours going out to work."

She even stayed up late to get to know me and plans that my husband and I had as he was arriving the next morning. She also made time to have tea and coffee with us in the mornings to talk about the previous day and our plans, offering many helpful tips and wonderful places to see. The apartment was immaculate, very clean and in a great neighborhood full of quaint boutiques, street vendors, coffee shops and pubs. It was also very close to the train station that took no time to get to the major London attractions. We loved exploring the city and common touristy things during the day, ending in a local pub in the Ivana's neighborhood at night. We would highly recommend booking with Ivana!"

13806334,115917375,2016-11-27,97255891,Elizabeth,"We have never been to an airbnb before, but definitely will again if this is an example!  We were made extremely welcome - everything was perfect."

13806334,201034971,2017-10-07,14985358,Ana Luísa,Lucy is a great host and the house is lovely. Lucy and her family were very helpful and assisted me in everything I needed. Highly recommend it!
13806334,211585438,2017-11-13,156355635,David,"This is a very comfortable accommodation, close to a bus route and around 1. 5 miles from Wimbledon Village, I would highly recommend this accommodation."
13806334,293030017,2018-07-19,31126257,Kim,Spacious upstairs room in beautiful English style manor. Pleasant suburb near to Southfield tube. Highly recommended.
13806334,324505389,2018-09-17,36270826,Darach,"The room is very spacious. The beds were very comfy too. There's a nice couch to relax on too.<br/><br/>Lucy let us use the washing machine which was greatly appreciated as we were staying for 13 nights.<br/><br/>The shower is nice and Lucy provided new big bath towels also.<br/><br/>The location is great for getting a bus up to Putney or down to Wimbledon town. I was getting the Northern Line into the city for work so it suited me.<br/><br/>Overall we had a great stay. <br/><br/>One negative would be that, on three separate occasions, someone walked into the room while we were there. Waking us up on one occasion too."
13806334,332380336,2018-10-05,71251897,Laura,A most welcoming home and superbly equipped for guests.  Perfect for our requirements.  Lucy and Mike are charming hosts. Thank you very much and we look forward to staying again.

The place is large, clean and very welcoming - the room is much bigger than any I have rented in the area. They have a dog but it's very quiet and friendly, usually locked away in the kitchen/living room. The upstairs shower is also great. I'd love to stay here again in the future."

13826971,103589838,2016-09-23,2526063,Danny,We had a great stay at Geraldine's apartment. The location is very nice and quiet and within walking distance of Camden Town and underground stations. <br/><br/>The house is nice and comfortable and with a very pleasant garden area.<br/><br/>A wonderful option for a London stay.

13826971,134100824,2017-02-26,3017073,Aurelia,We had an excellent stay in this cosy Victorian house and Geraldine was super nice.

13826971,145451800,2017-04-18,120335385,Christine,"We very much recommend this charming and friendly place! Nice and safe neighborhood, pubs for a pint in the evening in walking distance. Only a few minutes walk to the 24 bus (a few stops to Camden Town Station, apr. 20 minutes to Trafalgar Square, a few stops to Hamstead Heath with nice little shops and cafes and a beautiful park).  Geraldine was very nice and helpful with everything. We especially enjoyed having a cup of tea in  the sun in her very nice little garden!"

13826971,242554191,2018-03-12,3590488,John,"Beautiful flat over three floors with a lovely garden. Charming, homely, felt like country living in the middle of London, just ten minutes on foot from Camden Lock Market and good bus links to major train stations and the Lock Market itself, as well. Geraldine was incredibly helpful, friendly, and welcoming. Would highly recommend, especially for a longer stay where you might be looking for more than just a roof and a bed."
13826971,252341618,2018-04-10,51394425,Ankit,"Very homely, comfortable and clean place. Nicely located and Geraldine is always prompt with communication and very caring to our needs."
13826971,256647627,2018-04-23,32708080,Andrew,Great house. Great host. Would absolutely stay again when in London.
13826971,261328544,2018-05-06,8909959,Frederick,"We were very lucky to spent 6 nights in Geraldine's home. <br/>The extra bathroom is a real plus, especially if you are a couple of guests. <br/><br/>The house is located just off Chalk Farm Station and the Nothern Line connects you well to London.<br/><br/>Geraldine's kitchen is super well equipped. You'll find all crockery and cutlery to prepare breakfast/dinner. <br/><br/>And if you're fortunate to have some sunny spells during your visit, you can enjoy her beautiful little garden. <br/><br/>We rate Geraldine (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) % recommended and we're happy to return!"
13826971,267297332,2018-05-21,8818987,Maureen,We really enjoyed staying at Geraldine's flat on our recent trip to London.  It has a wonderful ambience that really makes you feel at home.  The back patio is so enjoyable in the morning that it can be hard to get out and start the day.  There is plenty of room for a family to hang out in the kitchen and living room area.  The kitchen is well equipped for eating in and the TV is set up to watch Netflix and plenty of BBC!  She also has a very good selection of DVD's.  The street is quiet but there are several small shops nearby for necessities.  There is a bus stop across the street that takes you down through Camdentown to Kings Cross/St Pancras while the Northern line tube stop is about a 10 minute walk.  Hampstead Heath is also about a 10 minute walk and my husband went running there a couple of mornings.  Belsize Park with nice restaurants and food shops is also about a 10 minute walk.  Geraldine is a  very friendly host and is lovely to have a chat with.  She was also very flexible about check-in and check out.

13826971,287414006,2018-07-08,105442581,Fei,Quiet location. You can get to the centre very easily. Geraldine is a great host and respond quickly.
13826971,406852266,2019-01-31,13884602,Kat,"Geraldine's house was a great place to stay for an extended time with a family.  Geraldine was very hospitable and the house was very comfortable.  It was easy to cook and relax. As a family, we love this part of London - the house is situated between Kentish Town, Belsize Park, and Hampstead with easy access to buses, underground, and overground."
13826971,416196010,2019-02-24,9139647,Ivar,"We spent two weeks in Geraldine’s house and it was a good experience. Geraldine is very helpful host and the communication was very good. The house itself is a part of old Victorian townhouse, so it’s an opportunity learn something about english way of living. It is clean and well equipped and has everything I needed including washing machine, wifi, etc. The area is quite enough and the house is about 10 minutes walk from Chalk Farm underground station and 15 minutes walk from Camden Market — a place full of street food, pubs and shops. King’s Cross railway station is about 20 minutes by bus. I would definitely recommend this place for living."
13826971,421024262,2019-03-08,66773000,Vasile,"We spent almost two weeks at Geraldine's house and we really enjoyed it. It is in a nice neighborhood, on a quiet street. The bus stop is around the corner and few tube and one overground station 10 minutes walk.<br/>We were there with our two children and loved the place. It is a nice, comfortable house with three bedrooms and two baths. We liked the fact that the kitchen and living room were on the ground floor so the kids could sleep upstairs while we watched a show. The house was sparkling clean at our arrival and found all the necessities (toilet paper, soap, detergent for the washer/dryer) for the beginning of our stay. Compared to other Airbnb's we stayed the kitchen had a multitude of pots, pans, oil, spices, tea, coffee. We really did not cook but if you want to you will have everything available. We had a great communication with Geraldine prior and during our stay. She answered all our questions quick and detailed. Her house manual is probably the best I have seen in all our vacation rentals. Very clear instructions for everything in the house. We would definitely return."
13826971,428496040,2019-03-25,115089866,Thomas,"What a wonderful home and a great location! The tube and bus are very close so you are only a quick ride away from Central London without being in the crowds! Lots of little markets, restaurants, and pubs are all a couple of minutes walk and Camden Market only a 15 walk away!Geraldine was friendly, communicative, and very informative about the area! I highly recommend taking a walk about Hamden Heath and strolling the Queen Crescent Market on Saturday. We will definitely be back!"
13826971,444055112,2019-04-27,14481481,Michel,Our stay in Geraldine’s house has been perfect. We’ve been able to spent a sunny week making our daughters discover London (and Cambridge) while having a very quiet and comfortable haven for the evening and the night. The house is typical but also very well equipped and functional. Bus at 3 mn and underground at 10mn walk was convenient. Geraldine instructions were clear and communication easy and quick. We would definitely come again and thank her for our stay
13826971,458559002,2019-05-26,100032041,Namita,"If you are looking for an authentic "" Living in an English home ""is Geraldine's place is the place to go . Her house is cute and well kept. Since it is a house where she lives , it has a very cosy and lived-in air . Would highly recommend it"
13826971,473332667,2019-06-21,54229775,Katie,"Geraldine's home was lovely, cozy, and comfortable. We had everything we needed to make our stay feel like we were at home. The kitchen is especially well-equipped, and the garden is such a lovely spot to sit and relax. The location is convenient and it's a pleasant walk to some of the nicest neighborhoods in North London. Geraldine was easy to reach and ready to help if any issues came up. We would love to stay here again in the future, and our only regret is not booking for a second week."
13826971,478993922,2019-06-30,191898887,Alex,"Great place! Great location away from the hustle and bustle, but close enough to pop in when you need. Camden, the zoo, the canal, Hampstead Heath, Primrose Hill all a stones throw away. Geraldine is the perfect, easy going host."
13826971,491611951,2019-07-20,21660772,David,"What a great house. For a family of four, it felt like a treat to stay in a Victorian house. Very well maintained with a great kitchen. No complaints at all!"
13826971,507261411,2019-08-11,101687602,Ben,"The property is well located, a little old and sparse but charming and thoughtfully decorated. Kitchen amenities were good with a nice garden space which caught the sun late morning / early afternoon. All rooms, especially bathroom were clean and in good order. <br/>I would recommend staying with Geraldine who was helpful and promptly replied to all queries we had. There were 5 of us staying over the weekend."

We walked to everywhere that we wanted to go to. Primrose Hill, Belsize Park and  Camden are all only a ten minute walk away. It really felt like a home away from home. Great place to stay"
13826971,748866100,2021-04-15,1286525,Anna,"Geraldine’s home is a perfect base whilst in London. We absolutely loved the space and layout of the house over 3 floors including a lovely garden. It was a real home from home during our stay, and Geraldine was a fantastic host from start to finish!"
13826971,395409791871504315,2021-06-29,99843770,Guy,"Geraldine's place was a perfect staging post for our week in London. Clean, comfortable and with all of the bits and pieces that a family needs for a short stay.  She was in contact early on to make the landing really easy. 3 bedrooms with - all double beds, and with a spare pull out single bed. <br/><br/>Also a lovely little garden (London size) where we spent some great evenings. <br/><br/>Overall great."
13826971,407716905575330765,2021-07-16,322569258,David,"Lovely house perfectly situated for access to Camden, City Centre and Hampstead Heath."
13826971,421466452514508541,2021-08-04,140958689,Susan,"Geraldine's home was perfect for our family stay. Downstairs provided the perfect setting for the family to enjoy cooking, eating, and relaxing in the tranquil garden. The bedrooms were a good size. The location was ideal for walks into Camden Market, Hampstead Village, and Hampstead Heath. We would defiantly return."
14137784,95068338,2016-08-18,23924385,Helen,We stayed 3 nights here and found the property a great base for our visit to London. Marcus & Sarah arranged access via a friend which worked very well and it was a good home from home option for us. 
14137784,96830912,2016-08-24,46646959,Andrew,"The apartment at first was a little odd and took some getting used to but we came to love it's idiosyncrasies in the brief few days we were there. On the plus side it is ideally placed with lovely glimpses of London as you meander down the hill to get a morning breakfast. It's within walking distance of Archway and buses so getting into London itself is easy and it's the perfect place to relax on the small patio with a glass of wine after the mayhem of the city. Some useful tips for those intending to stay here... the shower, though powerful enough, drains very slowly so it's advisable to make sure the water is hot enough or you'll receive a cold foot bath initially on entry; beds are subjective things I know and though I like a hard mattress, for me these beds were on the very hard side; if you have a car, parking is uncontrolled except between 10-12 weekdays and you can only pay for 1.5 hours in the same location so you need to move the car to be sure to escape a ticket. Not a problem if you're in our around the apartment but no good for heading into London. Highgate station though has a small carpark and we paid the very reasonable £6 all day charge while we went to see the sights.<br/>So the important question I always have is would I stay here again and the answer is yes. We really loved the place and were sorry to be leaving. It's in a beautiful area opposite Highgate cemetery, very quiet, close to amenities and the provided easy access to the target of my stay. It ticks the boxes for me."
14137784,138573844,2017-03-20,2702966,Raffaele,"Magnus and Sarah cottage is a real good choice if u are travelling with a group of people. It's in a real quite area but 10/15 min walk to the archway tube stop. The house is old and nice with a quite garden that I would have loved to use if I had some good weather :) Magnus is a very kind and careful host. I believe that this cottage is a particular, charming option to stay in London at a fair price."
14137784,140872942,2017-04-01,96022156,Jane,"We had a really lovely stay in this beautiful cottage. If you like quirkiness with feeling right at home, you've hit the jackpot with this place. It was so relaxing sitting in the garden watching the abundance of wildlife including visits from the local cats....& Carlos the squirrel! You can't get much better with the location. Very quiet road and opposite beautiful Highgate Cemetary, but only a few minutes walk to an abundance of cafes, pubs, shops and amenities. As well as Hampstead Heath & the gorgeous Waterlow Park. And you can be in central London in 20 mins. Magnus and Sarah were fantastic hosts and always at the end of the phone if you have any queries. I highly recommend this lovely cottage and would definitely stay there again."
14137784,143582499,2017-04-12,57267949,Musse,Ett roligt och udda (på ett bra sätt) boende i ett område med bra restauranger. Tillhörande trädgård och spökfritt trots närheten till kyrkogården. Gillade allt med det.
14137784,188383100,2017-08-29,32793445,Jean,"We spent a really lovely 10 days in the cottage with our two teenage children, and it was a great base for our trip to London. The cottage is pretty and there was plenty of room for everyone to have their own bedroom and a little space. The backyard was really lovely, and nice place to sit and have coffee or tea in the morning, or a glass of wine in the evening. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful, and it's an easy walk down the hill to the bus stop and to a few cafes and restaurants, or an easy walk up the hill into Highgate, where there are more restaurants, pubs, and shops. Hampstead Heath is a very short walk away, and we had lovely weather so it was nice to spend some time there. Camdentown, and the Camden Market, is a short bus ride away, and anywhere in London is easily accessible by tube. The house was clean and had everything we needed, and Magnus and Sarah were super helpful and responsive to any questions we had, and very flexible about checking in and out. We loved our stay here, and we'd stay at the cottage again in a heartbeat. It was a really peaceful place to come home to at the end of a day of sightseeing."
14137784,209527887,2017-11-05,2925366,Sophie,"A beautiful, cosy cottage in a delightful leafy neighbourhood. Magnus was so accomodating; we couldn't have asked for a better place for our friends to stay for our wedding."
14137784,217473861,2017-12-09,2833102,Benjamin,"Looks pretty but is ultimately unpractical.<br/><br/>The location is about 15 mins walk from nearest shops and 20 mins walk to the tube/subway to central London. <br/><br/>It’s relatively quiet and there’s a nice little garden. The house is full of character with comfy seating in the living room and a big kitchen. There’s no dining table, only bar stools around a kitchen counter. <br/><br/>The beds are small (narrow) and poor quality mattresses. One of the master bedrooms is beneath the roof and requires ‘sliding’ into from the front of the bed as the roof is immediately above the bed. No sitting up at night without banging your head. Another room has the single bed wedged between roof and pillars, again making for a rather claustrophobic sleeping experience.<br/><br/>The hot water isn’t hot until you let it run for more than 10 minutes and even then it fluctuates between cool and warm, never hot. We had to boil water with the kettle to get the water up to temperature in which to bathe our little boy.<br/><br/>There were no dish towels or even a dustpan which we all had to buy ourselves. There were however cupboards full of pasta and other dry goods to which we were told we could help ourselves. Shame they took up all the room for anything we wanted to put in here.<br/><br/>So between uncomfortable sleep, cold showers and a location that makes getting to central London a 1 hour journey, this place may have character but it simply wasn’t practical for us.<br/><br/>Oh, and there were several sightings of mice and big black spiders throughout our stay as well. In the kitchen and both downstairs bedrooms."

14137784,287385828,2018-07-08,75104938,Mia,"This is a lovely cottage in one of my favourite parts of London. We loved walking across the Heath, or up to the VIllage for a gourmet pub Lunch or simply enjoying a ride on the C2 into Camden for the best ice-cream in the world. For families with older kids exploring London this is a great place to stay. After a long, hot days in London it was so nice to come back to the quiet streets and views of Highgate. "
14836659,175704394,2017-07-29,32377798,Mike,"Lucy is a fabulous host and the communication with her great throughout the process. <br/><br/>The apartment is in a good location with easy access to public transport, shops and restaurants. Lucy's recommendation of The Chelsea Bun cafe was perfect for a great breakfast. <br/><br/>The room was very clean and the bed comfy. We had everything we needed. We also used the kitchen & living room and shared a couple of glasses of wine with Lucy one evening chatting away. <br/><br/>We would recommend Lucy's place if you are looking to stay in Chelsea and want a river view with a great host.

14836659,258602699,2018-04-29,31998494,Marin,"Loved staying at Lucy's place. Located in a beautiful area. About 30 min out of the city center by bus but the location is beautiful. Right in front of water.  The apartment is spacious and very cozy. Lucy was very helpful, sweet and quick to respond. Would definitely recommend for travelers that are looking for a quiet and peaceful place to stay at during their vacation."

14836659,351009345,2018-11-21,116673387,Susanne,"Lucy's place is a home away from home. The room is comfortable. The flat is speckless. Lucy is very welcoming. The location is brilliant. For sandwiches, Portuguese cakes and really good coffee I recommend the Lisboa delicatessen in the tower block, for a fancy meal The World's End Market just around the corner."
14836659,353309772,2018-11-27,20107350,Charlotte,We had a fabulous (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with her was great and she made the check in super easy. Lucy is really charming and a delight to be around. We warmly recommend her as a host  and would love to stay at her’s again when we are back in London.

14836659,366277306,2019-01-02,138899148,Mitchell,"Lucy’s place is great. Far enough outside of central London to escape the madness but close enough that getting anywhere was a snap. The busses and underground are essential for staying here so I highly recommend getting a travel card to allow ease of transport. <br/>Lucy was extremely friendly and accommodating, being friendly and conversation while also giving my girlfriend and I the space we needed when we wanted to be alone. I can’t express how much that meant to us."
14836659,401373662,2019-01-14,67807705,Nayul,very nice
14836659,407524689,2019-02-02,12292436,Serkan,Lucy's description about the place was accurate.  She was friendly and nice. We stayed there as a family.  And we had privacy and enough space to hang out.  It's was great choice for us to discover London as location. There are good and cheap cafes to eat breakfast and meals such as The Chelsea Bun and Mona Lisa. For pancake lovers there is My Old Dutch in 15 minutes by walking or two stops away with bus on King's Road.  As location is also walking distance to Chelsea FC Stadium for football fans.  We stayed there for 15 days and we didn't have any problems. London was very cold for us but the apartment was warm :)<br/>Thanks Lucy...
14836659,417434030,2019-02-27,229576413,Britta,"Lucy was a great host! She provided everything we needed and always  complied our wishes or needs. When we had any problems, we always found a solution. It was a lovely and uncomplicated stay."

The house is very warm, this is important for people who come from a warm country.<br/>The house is very neat and clean and you will feel really like in your home.<br/>An absolutely recommended stay, for short or long stays!"
15142942,255710781,2018-04-21,20267309,Alice,"Elle’s flat is cozy, homey, clean and so much more than what the pictures show. <br/>Located in one of my favorite areas of London, with lots of bars, restaurants etc.<br/>I would love to stay at Elle’s place again,  next time I’m in London. <br/><br/>Communication with Elle was easy, she was flexible with my early check in and very helpful with recommendations to the area."
15142942,265834262,2018-05-18,271909,Nathan,"Elle’s place is an East London gem, highly recommended. We used to live in the area and so know it well, and the location of her flat is excellent, looking over Broadway Market and easy to get onto the canal to walk to Victoria Park.  There’s a loading zone just outside so great for coming and going in a taxi/uber. The flat itself is lovely and bright, comfortable and stylish with personal touches and good amenities. Checking in was simple, all in all a great Airbnb experience! Thanks for hosting us Elle, if it’s available next visit, we’ll certainly book again.  Nathan"
15142942,288207236,2018-07-09,190769967,Chelsea And Christine,"Elle's place is absolutely perfect! It is in the heart of Broadway Market where there are amazing restaurants and people. On Saturdays, the famous Broadway Market opens up for all your food, music, produce and clothing needs! <br/> Elle was an amazing host (although we did not get to meet her in person) as she was very easy to stay in contact with! The house is located near various bus stops which takes you to central London. It is also near an overground station (Cambridge Heath) and about a 15 min walk to the tube (Bethnal Green). We will definitely stay here again. Thanks for being such an amazing host Elle! Hope to come back soon :) x"
15142942,327068703,2018-09-23,1597515,Anastasia,"Elle is a great host. Everything was super accurate. We agreed about late chak out which was essential. The area is very lively, with lots of cafes and bars but the bedroom is very quiet."
15142942,346116981,2018-11-07,2959916,Emmanuelle,I had a great time at Elle's place! Highly recommended!
15142942,347492495,2018-11-11,44814440,Mark,Elle was great at communicating and flexible about checking in and checking out but:<br/><br/>Whilst the location is fine for Broadway Market it is tricky to get into central and you need to be prepared to use an Uber. <br/><br/>We found the flat cold as the heating was inadequate. There were issues with the bathroom: heated towel rail didn’t work so it was cold and towels stayed wet and the sink was cracked and leaked. <br/><br/>Flat needs a refurb. <br/><br/>We were unlucky and there was a party next door one night until 4.00am so no sleep.
15142942,351901469,2018-11-24,75927936,Nazia,"Beautiful and spotless place, perfect location in East London. You would struggle to find better."

15142942,489707656,2019-07-17,201457865,Rebecca,"Great flat in an excellent location! We stayed here for a few days and loved the location - close to cafes, restaurants, transport and everything you need. Although on a Main Street it’s really quiet as the bedroom is at the back.<br/><br/>We stayed with a young baby so it was nice to be able to spread out as the flat is quite large with bedrooms upstairs and kitchen/living downstairs.<br/><br/>Elle was a great host even offering a baby bath or anything else we need. Would highly recommend!"
15142942,510473066,2019-08-16,79286886,Massimiliano,This is a good and convenient place to stay: it’s in a nice area and 5 min walk from bus stop with many buses going into the City / Liverpool Street. The apartment is spot clean with literally everything you would need. <br/><br/>Elle was great in communication and very easy check-in / checkout .<br/><br/>Will consider again next time I will be in London
15142942,517107918,2019-08-25,13984953,Kimmy,"Elle's place is wonderful and in my favourite part of town right on Broadway Market. Elle was really helpful, everything went smooth and her home is clean, comfortable and has lovely decor. I would highly recommend staying here and will definitely try and come back!!

15142942,619817495,2020-03-19,37681990,Vivienne,"this is the worst experience i've ever had with an airbnb. the host said we could leave the property and that we could have a refund and then refused to give us a refund! this is hugely expensive as it was 4 / 7 days that she wouldn't refund. we tried to return since we couldn't get the refund and she said she had filled the space. she also came round after we had self checked into the house while we were being intimate, it was awful. do not stay here unless you want no privacy despite renting the entire space and you want your money stolen. i am currently pursuing legal claims with airbnb."
15142942,621659609,2020-04-03,75765541,Agnes,"Such a lovely apartment in a great location. Had everything we needed and was a lovely stylish, clean, cosy place.

You are located right in the middle of beautiful Broadway market with the canal, Victoria park and all the best coffee shops and restaurants near by! The flat is equipped with absolutely everything you could need and is bright, airy and the perfect home from home. I’m a Londoner born and bred and this was one of the most lovely stays I’ve had in my home town. Couldn’t recommend more "
15142942,764739774,2021-05-31,84963668,Caitlin,"My parents had a lovely stay in Elle’s flat. All communication was extremely quick and clear and we had no issues at all.<br/><br/>The flat is great, especially the lovely living space and bathroom, and the location is fantastic. My parents were a bit worried about noise given how busy broadway market is but the flat was surprisingly quiet. Would definitely return!"

15142942,430156937560096139,2021-08-16,78823844,Amy & Ellen,"Elle’s home was absolutely perfect for our trip . It was more spacious in real life with a beautiful living area and a lovely big bathroom . The location couldn’t be more brilliant as you are right in the heart of it all , but up the slightly quieter end of the market road . Elles communication was perfect , she made check in very simple & easy , and made us feel very welcome , bending over backwards to offer helpful things for our baby . An absolutely lovely stay , just wish we could have stayed longer !"
15142942,481686557858203294,2021-10-26,40447272,Rosanna,"This is a great location in a nice area.  The flat is big, as other reviews have stated, and you will have plenty of space to spread out! The location of the bedroom is in the back, and very quiet at night--surprisingly quiet.  Friday night there was a bar playing loud bass until 3:30 am, but my jetlag may have contributed to my hearing it--if I had been sleeping better, I may not have noticed!<br/>The market and pedestrian street is so nice--very little vehicle traffic--watch both ways for bikes! Steps away to multiple coffee shops and grocery markets.  I love yarn, and who knew I could get some right next door?!  So many food options. Also, the canal is pretty to stroll along, and there is a bus stop across the way, and Bethnal green tube station is not too far away--nice walks and I felt safe.  London Fields is so pretty and close by.<br/>Elle was SO quick to respond to every message and was available to call with answers to questions if needed. Her responses were always within minutes, literally!! Thank you for leaving a treat, and for having such a comfortable, welcoming space, Elle! I loved my stay!"

I would highly recommend her place as it's very easy for getting to central London and exploring the city. Was within walking distance of the train station which was brilliant as we had no need to use taxis. Jays place was very clean, beautifully furnished, fast wifi and an extremely comfy bed! Jay was very easy to communicate with and even let us drop our bags off before check in time which was great! I will definitely stay here again when I next visit London. "
15340247,121679244,2016-12-18,90467737,Emma,Good location. <br/>Jay is an excellent host. <br/>Flat was really clean and tidy. <br/>Will definitely book again. 
15340247,124151809,2017-01-01,18484411,Danny,Very nice apartment. Walking distance from many restaurants and you can get a cheap Uber to go to central London (just 6-8pounds).

15340247,142775283,2017-04-09,4931595,David,The flat is nice enough but it's further from Clapham Junction than advertised and the shower is terrible. 
15340247,144656783,2017-04-16,16226445,Keith,Jay was excellent and her apartment was very well kept. I really enjoyed my stay and will recommend to anyone. It's not far from central london so many touristy options are available.
15340247,146544512,2017-04-23,102318806,Therese,I booked Jay's flat for my parents visit to London for the weekend. The flat was very much looking like the pictures posted and had a good location close to Lavender hill and Clapham junction. Very clean and great hosting.<br/>
15340247,148688658,2017-05-01,17313113,Yina,"Bed was comfortable, and the living room and kitchen area were nice. Quiet and safe neighborhood. Check in and check out were easy. It's not the closest to central London and requires some walking to get to the main street where all the restaurants and shops are. The bathroom is small and the bathtub is  only partially covered by a screen, plus the showerhead is powerful so it's kind of difficult to take a shower without getting the bathroom floor all wet. The bedroom has no natural sunlight so you can't tell if it's morning or night. Otherwise it was okay."

15830141,274045239,2018-06-08,193850740,Ultimo,"I was in London for work and the location was fantastic. Two minutes walk to a train station and bus stop even closer. You can get from the flat to central very easily and quickly, or if you want to be East then it’s a great place to be. There's a Sainsbury's within the building and the areas is buzzing with local shops. Anna & Nick were great hosts, they had recommendations for places to eat and drink nearby. The WiFi was brilliant! It was really easy communicating with Anna before my stay and during my time there they were interested in what I was doing and interesting when I asked about them. The room and entire flat was very clean and comfortable in fact, the bed is one of the most comfortable that I have stayed in. The room is spacious and minimalist but has everything you need, TV hairdryer, towels and sheets. The shower room that’s attached was nice with a large shower head, very luxurious. It meant that I had privacy and could keep to myself if I wanted. The flat has bright white walls and there are a lot of windows. The kitchen is offered for use along with the cutlery and crockery. I loved staying with Anna so much that I would recommend anyone should stay with them and I have booked in again for next week. Thanks again for a great stay."
15830141,277021058,2018-06-15,193850740,Ultimo,"This was my second stay with Anna & Nick, it was just as great as the first time, they are very welcoming and friendly. I highly recommend the apartment, the location and the hosts. It's even nicer when the sun is out as the balcony is south facing so you get the sun all day and into the evening. You can also see the London skyline from there too. I look forward to visiting again, you have such a lovely apartment. Thanks for having me."
15830141,280419017,2018-06-23,102671691,Jennifer,A great host!

15830141,454390797,2019-05-18,245245284,Dina,"Anna's place is amazing, it has good vibes and it's so beautiful. It's so bright as the sunlight is coming through windows and the lovely balcony. I was there right before an important exam, and this place helped me a lot to focus and to study well. Anna and Nick are lovely people and willing to help if you needed anything. And the neighborhood is lovely, full of restaurants of different cuisines. And it's nice and safe if you want to take a walk. Thank you so much for having me."

15934578,124581628,2017-01-02,26465838,Dawn,"Simona made us feel right at home! She even (Hidden by Airbnb) d with us beforehand to tell us a little about the flat. After a long journey from Cardiff, she met us and gave us keys and we settled in nicely. The flat is located near just about everything you need to make your stay pleasant. We even watched New Years fireworks from the wharf (literally about 50 ft out the door of the flat) and then walked easily back inside after they were finished-which was great! There was a Tesco express right on the corner and Pret a Manger on the other side, which was great to get a quick snack and bite for breakfast. Overall would recommend to couples and single travelers looking for a few days of rest. "
15934578,280424183,2018-06-23,20586050,Nathalie,"Great location , near everything. Simona was a great host."
15934578,769736276,2021-06-13,16119190,Francesco,"Perfect place in London. Location is perfect, studio size flat too. Eveything is within reach.<br/>Mona is a caring, sunny and gorgeous host. She has been always there for me and for any question or suggestion I might have. The balcony is a plus, the building is lovely and modern.<br/>I will surely come back again and again in the future."

Internet speed is really good and there is a desk with a monitor which is great if you have to work during your stay. She was very helpful with check-in and check-out and I had a great stay."

16118916,126135785,2017-01-09,1639437,Stuart,"It's almost a reflex to say you'd like to return to a good Airbnb property. But this time I'm certain. Mark's home is a studio, but that label doesn't do it justice. It's extremely spacious with lofty ceilings, airy and bright, and decorated with great artistry. The bathroom and kitchen are generously equipped and immaculate, all with true character. The tall windows overlook a small park, while Exmouth Market and its restaurants are just around the corner. Clerkenwell is my favourite part of London, and Mark's is the best of places I've stayed in the area. I recommend booking."

16118916,129530703,2017-01-31,38488569,Kerri,"The flat was Amazing! Even better than the pictures. It was spotlessly clean and incredibly stylish. The temperature was good and easy to amend if necessary. The bed linens and towels were good quality and in pristine condition. This is a great area of London to stay. All transport links are nearby, but if you like to get about on foot there is plenty to see. We walked to St Paul's in about 25 mins. Thanks for a wonderful stay Mark. We hope to revisit ."
16118916,130507307,2017-02-06,14649608,Trine,"Marks place is perfect for a couple wanting to spend some days in London. I could have lived there! <br/>Practical, comfortable, elegant and situated in a Great neighbourhood!<br/><br/>I loved the fact that the bed is really comfortable, the sofa perfect for an afternoon rest and the bathroom Nice and clean. <br/><br/>I would rent it again next time and also highly recommend it to my friends.

16153271,143344961,2017-04-11,19423459,Valentín,"El piso es ideal para dos parejas. Se distribuye en 3 pisos, es luminoso, limpio y sin grandes lujos. Está situado al lado de Camden Town, una zona con muchísimo ambiente, muy recomendable sumergirse en ella. Está situada muy cerca de una parada de autobús (Malden Road), nosotros lo usamos más que el metro, aunque también está muy cerca (Chalk Farm). <br/>Anna fue muy amable al recibirnos, incluso tuvimos un problema y llegamos tarde pero aun así se mostró muy amigable. Lo único malo es que vive lejos, tenedlo en cuenta si tenéis alguna cuestión durante vuestra estancia. "

16153271,498253220,2019-07-29,29867098,Thomas,Alles war zu unserer Zufriedenheit.

The transportation isn’t too far and the area was quiet and clean! Very well stocked kitchen and love the living room area, so bright and pretty!"
16153271,509358047,2019-08-14,32362616,Enrica,"We are a family from Italy and stayed at Anna's flat for a week. We had a comfortable time and enjoyed staying in this spacious, typically English home that has everything a traveller would like to have. We mostly liked the little datails that make the home even more cozy. The neighborhood is nice and very quiet, and the center of London can be reached quickly by bus or underground. It was a wery nice and relaxing vacation, we recommend it!"
16153271,515073813,2019-08-22,39437223,Jennifer,"The flat is spacious and very conveniently located, and communication with Anna was prompt and professional. The main issue was that the cleaner was still working on the flat when we arrived, even though we landed a day late due to travel delays. It was not the cleanest property we've stayed at but it is bright and has several assets, as mentioned earlier"
16153271,518749490,2019-08-27,61360862,Amber,"Anna made the entire process super easy! The place is in a great location and easy to walk to the park, pubs, public transport! We had some issues with the power going off, Anna was super quick to respond and it was all resolved quickly and easily so no dramas at all. Just be aware there are quite a few stairs! Normally this is not an issue for me (so I didn’t even think to check) but just prior to the trip I ended up injuring my ankle and in a moonboot which made moving throughout the house a little annoying but still manageable, but yes just be aware of stairs! Would stay here again purely for the location and ease of communicating with Anna. Thanks for a lovely trip."
16153271,764751949,2021-05-31,63904136,Valentine,"I had a wonderful time as the house is very quiet and very well located. Close to the supermarket, tube station, bicycle shop,etc. The area is lovely at a stone’s throw of Primrose Hill. Highly recommended as Anna provided many great places such as restaurants and places to go and visit. Best,"
16331881,123459901,2016-12-29,28925338,Jin,"A lovely and marvellous house in a calm and cozy area of London. Spending 3 days at Eden's house was such a great experience. Since it was a holiday for Eden, he was not there to welcome us, but thanks to his instructions, getting his home was problem free. The house was clean and so cozy. I recommend this place to anyone. Probably will be back soon!"
16331881,172205906,2017-07-20,23273723,Jesse,Great place and smooth check-in. It was a really cool apartment and an excellent deal. Very happy I stayed ther. Thanks :)

16365885,176694826,2017-07-31,22273837,Ahmed,Amy and her husband Chao are very helpful and the communication was really good. I had to check out on Monday and I was having the weekend in Amsterdam. I missed my flight Monday morning and they arranged another plan for me to take my suitcase from the apartment. I would go there again

16397301,145400169,2017-04-18,34845009,Klaas,Great and clean apartment. Would definitely recommend it to anyone! Good value for money!
16397301,146327395,2017-04-22,34943917,Sean,"The house is really cozy and well done! You will feel right at home. It is clean, as described, and has everything you need to un-wind and relax from busy London. <br/><br/>This is a great location in southern Southwark. As a transitional neighborhood it is really a great location for the value. Its not a bad hike to the Tube station, but be prepared to walk 15 minutes. There seems like a lot of interesting international places to eat along the street. If this is the area you want to stay in, this would be my top pick. "
16397301,149398010,2017-05-04,3058217,James,"Comfortable and functional flat, that is a good value for such an expensive city.  We would stay here again"

Also, bus service runs both directions on the street outside the flat. It's a great value. We recommend it and will rent it again. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br/><br/>Julie"
16397301,159191418,2017-06-10,19652145,Alicia,Stephen's place was incredibly comfortable and relaxing.  It was easy to navigate the city and his recommendations were spot on.
16397301,162250470,2017-06-20,26385198,Rashmi,"Had a lovely stay at Stephens place! Stephen's directions and house manual were very useful, and easy to follow. The bus stop across the road gives easy access (20-30 mins, depending on time of day) to most tourist spots in the city centre. The house is well stocked (especially the kitchen essentials) and we were comfortable right from day 1. The only minor niggle was that the bathroom is smaller than what we are used to - diminutive me did not have any problems, but my husband kept getting his elbows knocked :)<br/>All in all, a place I would recommend to fellow travelers to London! <br/>"
16397301,164902564,2017-06-29,57632739,Amy,"Very comfortable flat, nicely updated. Extremely convenient to grocery stores and to multiple bus lines fanning out in every direction. Diverse neighborhood also a plus!"

16397301,167492579,2017-07-07,17051578,Deniece,Overall the apartment was nice however the area wasn't the best. My husband and I had to walk to a local shopping center and felt uncomfortable.
16397301,169050517,2017-07-11,22492300,Natalie,C'est un petit appartement très mignon et calme. <br/>Tout proche il y a une épicerie ouverte très tard <br/>Ce n'est pas un charmant quartier mais à quelques minutes il y a une rue géniale pleine de restaurants sympa <br/>bermondsay road 
16397301,171851279,2017-07-19,113894512,Brittany,"Stephen's apartment was extremely tidy and comfy. Super easy to get into and he responded so quickly to messages. It was smaller than expected but it was perfect for what we needed. I wouldn't recommend more than 3 people.<br/>However, it was easy to access transport and the supermarket across the road was extremely convenient! I'd highly recommend! "

16397301,185916485,2017-08-23,122229727,Eva,"Stephen's flat is beautiful, and is represented well by his posted photos. It is a great place to return to, after the hustle and bustle of London. After figuring out the bus routes, it became quite easy to reach downtown.  Communication with Stephen is immediate and his tips are very helpful, in terms of navigating such a busy place. We would return here without hesitation."
16397301,195835888,2017-09-21,44369758,Christina,"There was a lot to like about Stephen's apartment.  It was very stylishly decorated as well as being immaculate.  I liked that it was modern, but mixed with vintage pieces.  We loved the heated bars in the shower and having a washing machine helped as well.  The bed was super comfy and again loved that way it was decorated.  I would highly recommend Stephen's airbnb to anyone visiting London!"
16397301,207352348,2017-10-29,119300525,Diane,"Experience 'living' in the city in this cozy, well-kept flat. Just the necessities here; nothing to complicate your stay.<br/>Great proximity to Tower Bridge Rd and walkable routes to two tube stops."
16397301,235564900,2018-02-17,11211899,Anthony,Pretty much as all the other reviews have found Stephen's flat is modern charming and convenient. I know the area and the old Kent road still isn't the most glamorous part of town but it's more than made up for for it's central location/access to Elephant and Castle's transport links.  More importantly the flat is really charming and well put together.  Nice attention to detail and check in and check out is incredibly efficient.
16397301,242795852,2018-03-13,78195054,Antonia,"Stephen’s place is very clean and comfortable! Not the most central location, but there are bus stops right outside the flat. Thank you Stephen for a lovely, peaceful stay!"
16397301,243777179,2018-03-17,99708663,Alyssa,"We found booking with Stephen to be very easy! He provided very detailed instructions for arrival and checkin, as well as great info for transportation and local restaurants. Apartment was very clean. All in all good value for our few nights' stay in London and recommended for other travelers."
16397301,245468357,2018-03-22,12460429,Sefik,"Very nice place - super central, only a few minutes walk from a (good) bunch of restaurants, attractions, etc. Stephen is extremely easy to communicate with and check-in/out was some of the most efficient I have experienced with AirBNB. Highly recommended"
16397301,246857469,2018-03-26,126839516,Terry,"Stephen has a wonderful spot, perfect for exploring central London. It’s a nice walk to the tower bridge which I highly recommend doing.  You’ll pass restaurants and shops and be amazed at the views.  The Elephant Castle metro station is about a half mile away with bus service out the front door to help you connect. The accommodations are comfortable with an updated interior to offset the building’s more rustic appearance. It is quiet at night and many nearby shops to help you stock up on essentials for your stay.  We had a wonderful time in London and would recommend Stephen’s crib to any of our friends."
16397301,260037494,2018-05-03,174034781,Kayla,Incredible space. Incredible host! Next time I’m in London I will certainly rent one of his homes again!
16397301,265455242,2018-05-17,67749677,Andres,"It’s a great place to stay at. Easy to check in, near to public transport. Kitchen is fully equipped etc. would reccommend!"
16397301,268919981,2018-05-26,2345901,Gina,Cosy apartment in large block. Good access to public transport.
16397301,271383790,2018-06-01,133148837,Karina,"We enjoy a lot our stay with Stephen! The apartment is really modern,  calm, good to sleep, small but confortable! Thank you Stephen!"
16397301,278530180,2018-06-18,42175549,Nianna,"We do have good time in London. We spend 5days in Stephens place, convenient and lovely. Bus stops are 2 mins away, leading us to the city center, lovely. supermarket is just opposite. House is newly decorated, idea for couples to spend week here . Stephen is nice and patient, sharing lots of information about London. Thanks ."
16397301,280024006,2018-06-22,62752107,Stephen,Excellent hosts and wonderful space to stay in for our London visit. Thank you so much.
16397301,281624188,2018-06-25,61525244,Laura,We only spent a few nights at Stephen’s place while in London. Stephen had loads of tips and information. When originally seeing the photos I had thought the living space looked cluttered. It was anything but cluttered! It was very stylish. My husband even notes that this is one of the nicest air bnb’s We had stayed in. <br/>Great location with bus stops to get to any station easily.
16397301,284104511,2018-07-01,171078584,Brooke,Hi Stephen My daughter Brooke and I would just like to say we had such a wonderful time in London staying at your cosy warm and comfy flat . We had everything we needed there and felt very safe and at home . Also I must say that bed and Doona gave us both the best sleep ever. It was great also watching Netflix every night  after our day trips to London sight seeing . Also want to thank lovely Brenda in flat  21 for being so helpful to us when we arrived and so lovely to talk to . Thank you again Stephen would for sure recommend your beautiful flat to anyone wanting a comfortable stay away from home . Thank you again kind regards Bev and Brooke from oz
16397301,286881334,2018-07-07,153479203,Alice,The apartment was really clean and with great amenities. The location was great as it was very close to the bus stop which had busses coming every few minutes to make it easy to get around London. Overall it was a very great stay as the apartment was easy to find and very nice to stay in.
16397301,291086302,2018-07-15,6340300,Venetia,"Stephens place is well situated, he’s a very communicative host and the space is thoughtfully appointed with everything you need. I recommend it! "
16397301,303391137,2018-08-07,145833209,Danielle Hendricks,"Great space! I don't recommend it when it's hot out since there is not an A/C or fan. It's partially below ground, so we didn't feel comfortable leaving the windows open at night. Small space, but nicely updated! Close to multiple bus stops that can get you to better parts of the city."
16397301,309396080,2018-08-18,172699819,Elisa,"The apartment is in a very convenient location to reach all the major London attractions by bus, and even the transfer from the London City airport is very simple. In the same street there are many restaurants and supermarkets, including an ATM point, so the area is equipped with all the amenities. At our arrival the house was perfectly clean and tidy, also equipped with all basic necessities; the appliances were in perfect working order and the presence of a washer machine and dryer has also allowed us to save space in our suitcase. Perhaps the presence of a windowless bathroom may be slightly inconvenient, but overall we had a quality stay with no drawbacks or disadvantages."
16397301,322473590,2018-09-13,110451543,Erin,"A bright space, equipped with all the furnishings one could need to feel right at home. The comfortable bed and decorative details are the icing on the top. I would definitely recommend Stephens place to all my friends and family."
16397301,328113712,2018-09-25,70417744,Vineeta,"Stephen’s apartment is the coziest and prettiest ever. Even though my stay was really short, this apartment made me feel like home. The check in instructions were very easy and straightforward and I had complete privacy. This is s great place to stay if you are looking to commute via bus. Stephen was very prompt in replying and was really nice to communicate. I would definitely stay here again!"
16397301,349398931,2018-11-17,73775837,Deborah,"Great place to stay - nice touches and close to tubes, buses, places of interest. Comfy squishy bed, decent shower, shampoo, soap, loo roll, tea, coffee...and a pint of milk in the fridge...! We did have a little moment thinking that someone was in the property as a ""flushing"" sound happened as we walked in...it was the washing machine finishing...phew!! Lovely homely space, that was cosy and clean, warm and inviting...only stayed one night, but would have loved to stay there longer. Thanks for the comms Stephen, really good."
16397301,407521005,2019-02-02,196990186,Julie,Merci pour précision et accueil. Vous êtes très disponible.
16397301,418155689,2019-03-01,68552790,Francien,"Nice appartment in light and modern basement, always heated at 21 degrees Celsius. Very small but clean bathroom, with toilet, small basin and shower in bath. Good kitchen with lots of basic supplies. Nice bedroom with comfortable bed at the quiet back of the appartment (bedroomdoor can be locked from inside). <br/>Many connections to all parts of the city via busstop very close to the house. Very quick response from Stephen in case of questions.<br/>If you stay with more  than 2 persons, the living room doubles as a second bedroom. I would only recommand this option if you are not a light sleeper: living room is situated next to the entrance of te building. Although residents try to make as little noise as possible, you can hear their footsteps on the stairs and the heavy frontdoor closing."
16397301,428920966,2019-03-26,12680960,Lisa,"Although some have mentioned that the neighborhood can be a bit sketchy, we were perfectly comfortable there. The distance to the underground was a bit further than anticipated, but easily walkable, and there are buses just outside the apartment. The kitchen was small but serviceable; bathroom was tinier than expected. We especially enjoyed the Maltby Street market, Southwark Cathedral, & strolling along the south bank of the Thames."
16397301,451263092,2019-05-11,25197629,Diego,Departamento comodo en una buena zona en Londres.<br/>Solo tener en cuenta que el subte/metro/underground mas cercano es a 15 minutos a pie. Pero a solo 10 minutos en bus de London Bridge.
16397301,452886967,2019-05-14,69166989,Andrea,Stephens very cosy place is super well located with easy access to just about everywhere in London. Stephen is an excellent host as he has put a lot of thought into ensuring guests have a great stay through prompt communication and a great info package. If travelling on the Eurostar the 63 bus across the road will provide a direct link to Kings Cross/St Pancras without having to deal with stairs. You also have all you need on your doorstep Lidl across the road and restaurants close. The washer dryer was also an immense bonus. Stephen has made some styling updates so the pics don’t quite reflect what the flat looks like currently. The bath/shower may be a struggle for an older guest as it has a high hob in a snug space. Thanks Stephen for providing a great base for our stay in London !
16397301,484111016,2019-07-08,5303702,Roni,"We had great stay at Stephen's!  The location was close to many restaurants on Grange Rd, Tower Bridge Rd, and Bermondsey St and about a 20 to 30 minute walk to Tower Bridge, London Bridge, Borough Market and the hop on hop off City Hall stop.  We had great weather during our stay so enjoyed the walking!  Some restaurants we enjoyed nearby we're Cafe Amisha on Grange Rd, Constancia and Tower Tandoori on Tower Bridge Rd, also a small Lebanese Restaurant on Grange Rd.  There is a Lidl grocery store across Old Kent Rd and a smaller grocer just to the left of the flat on Old Kent that was well stocked.  The apartment was very comfortable and well equipped and Stephen was quick to answer any questions.  My husband is a big guy and found the small bathroom a bit tight but was fine for me.  Great value in London!"
16397301,490242841,2019-07-18,36999676,Rosemary,"Beautiful apartment in a convenient location. Has everything you could want. Stephen is a very helpful,friendly host."
16397301,512441321,2019-08-18,26905860,Elisa,"We spent a night at Stephen’s and had a lovey stay. The kitchen is equipped with breakfast necessities such as tea, milk, nescafe, butter, jam and cornflakes. The couch is super comfy; the mattress was a bit soft but that depends on taste. There were supplies in the shower and towels for everybody. It’s a basement flat, but it’s got windows and is very bright and overall very comfy. The self check-in worked perfectly fine as well. We got a lot of tips beforehand about the area and London in general. The area itself is not as central as you might wish, but it’s close enough, and there is a bus stop right in front of the door that gets you everywhere really quick (eg the 21 line that goes directly to Shoreditch via London Bridge). Overall we had a lovely stay! Do recommend :)"
16397301,531356853,2019-09-17,200833355,Caroline,"Stephen is an amazing host, highly recommend!! Very cozy place to stay in London, about 1 mile from nearest tube station."
16397301,536625807,2019-09-27,19838439,Vipul,Great place and full of character. Would recommend and nearby Bermondsey was very cool. Great communication from host as well
16397301,544057560,2019-10-09,69893027,Rod,"Stephen's place is great & just as it appears in the photos. Its in a great location, easily accessible, quiet and tastefully appointed. Stephen is a great communicator, always getting back to any enquiries very quickly."
16397301,546842643,2019-10-14,17951917,Edd,"Wondeful host, very helpful lots of great tips!"
16397301,552292343,2019-10-21,253941185,Karen,Amazing place! Super clean Close to so much and you can walk to buses and the tube station. And local spots on the way! We will be back!!
16397301,555210946,2019-10-27,97046636,Dan,Everything was great! Very easy to get to and from Central London.
16397301,572886044,2019-12-04,238505843,Rudolph,"I felt a pang of regret having to leave Stephen's apartment this morning. What a lovely flat. it has all the amenities you need, but more importantly Stephen has added a real heartbeat and style to it. This is not just a place to crash and sleep; it is a real home away from home. Public transport is @ walking distance, shops are close, and even though Old Kent Road is really busy, the flat is remarkably quiet, so you'll get a good sleep. Sparkling clean and Stephen is fantastic host."
16397301,578932264,2019-12-19,77172867,Kelsie,Stephens home is such a great space and in a great location. Near many places of London I would’ve never seen had I stayed in the tourist area. Great food nearby in any direction. A very private space that was easy to find and tucked away for some down time during our travels. Would highly recommend his home for your stay!
16397301,581695652,2019-12-25,256357158,Suhas,The experience has been very unpleasant. photographs of the place shown on the air Bnb listing website has no resemblance to the actual place. To start with it’s a dingy looking place which has a horrible stench of drainage in the complete flat.The kitchen is tiny with no necessities. Very old rundown place. Does not live up to the expectations built in the pictures and the ratings of the place. It has been such a waste of our investment and expectation of our stay here. We had to find another place immediately as the entire flat smells of drainage.... definitely not recommended. The utility like the washing machine are difficult to access. The toilets are dingy and smells.<br/>The surroundings are not like the images shared on Airbnb. All in all it has been a very unpleasant experience.
16397301,627440768,2020-06-02,44437362,Kevin,"Stephen is an outstanding host, providing extremely responsive and attentive service and a beautiful flat in a superb location! Cannot recommend this gentleman’s properties highly enough!"
16397301,668449678,2020-09-27,1501478,Bettina,"I stayed at Stephen’s place for almost 2 months and had an absolutely amazing time with everything I needed! The apartment is conveniently located across the street from a supermarket and in front of a few bus stops that take you anywhere in London. All the neighbors are quiet and a 1 mile walk takes you to Tower Bridge where you can picnic with a view! The apartment is also stylishly decorated with the London feel and has unlimited coffee, tea, and sugar. Stephen is also one of the best hosts I’ve come across with professional fast responses, understanding changing travel plans, accommodating early check-in, lots of local recommendations, and a genuine aura in hospitality that is rare these days. Thank you!"
16397301,751428788,2021-04-24,184724670,Andrew,"We had a wonderful six-month stay at Stephen’s place. Although we were in lockdown for much of the time, we found the flat very cozy and well-equipped, with a floor plan that permitted individual personal space when desired. It has been totally refurbished with tasteful decor. The location is very convenient, with Lidl and bus lines across the road, Tesco and lovely Burgess Park a 10-minute walk, very cool Bermondsey Street and smaller parks nearby, the wonderful Borough Market and London Bridge tube stop - and the Thames - a 20-minute walk. There is no shortage of shops and restaurants in this fun neighborhood and area. In spite of a location off a main thoroughfare the flat is quiet. It is a few steps down but large windows along one wall provide ample natural light. Stephen is a caring and responsive host who is very accommodating and dedicated to making your stay pleasant and successful. We were sorry to leave, as it truly felt like home."
16397301,419307521940940273,2021-08-01,69519113,Martin,"Stephens place was fantastic, great place, great value, great location and great host. Next time I’m in London this would be the first place I’d look!!"
16648005,126488348,2017-01-12,21578642,Justine,"Just lovely perfect stay, gorgeous hosts, wonderful nights sleep, very comfy, excellent use of space, great ensure, amazing to have a private entrance so you don't feel like you are going to wake anyone up if you come in late, clean, luxurious, every detail well thought out. Highly recommend!!"
16648005,126955749,2017-01-15,48083612,Laura,"Byron and Lauren's place was lovely. The room was clean, spacious, warm and comfortable. The bathroom was lovely, large and clean with a powerful shower. They provided tea, coffee and breakfast making facilities in the room and made our check in and out easy. We would definitely stay with them again. "
16648005,127828146,2017-01-21,12754425,Christine,"Très jolie chambre très cosy, accueil très chaleureux de laurenn, très sympathique , un petit cocon que je recommande vivement , endroit très bien desservi par les transports en commun<br/>Merci à vous!! "
16648005,127995240,2017-01-22,110146913,Stephanie,"We enjoyed a lovely one night stay here on a weekend trip to London. The room was cosy and nicely set out including tea/coffee and breakfast, extra blankets and books and even fairy lights and candles. The privacy is great and the flat itself is located really close to shops, restaurants and public transport to central London. Our hosts were laid back and lovely and made us feel very welcome. Would love to stay again! "
16648005,128229898,2017-01-23,22022483,Becca,She is so lovely and amazing! Could not suggest more!
16648005,128902253,2017-01-28,102582177,Lorraine,"The room is lovely and indépendant. Byron and Lauren are both lovely hosts, they are helpful and trust me, listen to them when they talk to you about a pizza restaurant near by. "
16648005,129768485,2017-02-02,23036594,Eleanor,Great place
16648005,130245476,2017-02-05,112058395,Giuseppe,Really good!
16648005,138262045,2017-03-19,55443703,Liam,"Byron and Lauren were wonderful hosts and the room was absolutely lovely. Plenty of fairy lights making it cosy, and a great choice of tea, coffee, cereals, and pastries for breakfast. The overground station was at the end of the road and the underground was within 10 mins walk so getting into central London was really easy. The bed was comfy and there was plenty of blankets available. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in London."
16648005,139067516,2017-03-23,113046689,Christian,"Wir haben drei Nächte in diesem schönen, gepflegten und liebevoll eingerichteten Zimmer nebst eigenem kleinem Bad verbracht. Gut gefallen hat uns auch der eigene Eingang, so dass beiderseits die Privatsphäre gewahrt blieb und keiner gestört wurde. Byron haben wir als sehr freundlichen und fürsorglichen Gastgeber kennengelernt. Bis zur Overground-Station Kensal Rise ist es nur ein Katzensprung. Auch die Anbindung mit dem Bus ist sehr gut, so dass die Unterkunft trotz nicht ganz zentraler Lage gut zu erreichen ist. An der nächsten größeren Straße gibt es eine Vielzahl von kleinen Läden, netten Restaurants und einen Pub. Wir können diese Unterkunft uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen und kommen gerne wieder!"
16648005,139644101,2017-03-26,113092718,Leon,"It was the perfect room for a perfect (!) weekend in London. Very lovely arranged, with all the things we need. <br/>Byron and Lauren were very helpful, friendly and we had great talks. Looking forward to meet them again! "

The room itself is very nice and clean with a private patio and entrance. Byron and Lauren are wonderful hosts with great recommendations. "
16648005,143059929,2017-04-10,5800968,Ginny,Byron and Loren are lovely and were great to deal with and very helpful when asked. The room is compact but well appointed and the location is close to public transport into London. It would be an ideal place for an individual or couple in London for a few days with little luggage who value independent access and spend their day out and about (as we were) and eat out in the evenings. 
16648005,143522283,2017-04-12,56882140,Sofie,Little cosy room with nice bathroom and great access to public transportation system: Direct bus to Piccadilly Circus (no 6 - takes about an hour but great sightseeing through London!) as well as fast access to the Bakerloo line! Very nice and welcoming couple! 
16648005,143760976,2017-04-13,71605213,Amy,"Lauren and Byron were fantastic hosts - excellent communication before the trip and then really accommodating when we arrived. The room is lovely and it's great that it's separate to their flat so you can come and go as you please. My daughter and I had a great time and really appreciated the tea, coffee and cereal provided. A great place to stay if you want a clean and tidy base when out and about in London. The area is lovely too, really leafy and feels safe. Thanks again! "
16648005,144287507,2017-04-15,54455494,Brenda,"Byron and his girlfriend were lovely! The room is really cute and beautiful, the location is pretty good, easy to find and to go to the touristic area in London. I had a delightful stay :)"
16648005,144569184,2017-04-16,49083160,Eric,Close to overground station. Byron and Laurie are very friendly indeed! The room is tidy and clean also! Highly recommended.

The bedroom had a really good arrangement, even though it's a little small. The room is perfect for a couple or two people if you don't mind sharing a bed. Byron was really helpful with every question or request we had. It was our first airbnb experience and thanks to Byron it was a really good one. "

16648005,162952951,2017-06-23,113160350,Dawn,We had a really great stay here while in London. Room is just like the pictures. Byron was very accommodating during check in and check out. Train station is a 1 minute walk away with shops very closeby. Location was very convenient. all in all it was a great stay!
16648005,164076896,2017-06-26,27882565,Julia,It was a Nice stay. Good Location with a small private Garden. The Communication was perfect and byron was very friendly! <br/>The only thing I missed was a fridge :) <br/>
16648005,164643389,2017-06-28,109537509,DeeDee,Charming. Quaint. Lovely. The owners have maximized a very small space. We really didn't need more space as we were just sleeping and showering there and on the move the rest of time.  
16648005,174883461,2017-07-27,44727805,Amy,"First air bnb London experience. Could not ask for anything better. A brilliant experience, friendly hosts and felt comfortable from the get go. Breakfast was provided and toiletries. Hosts made us aware of top places to eat and which buses to get. 5 stars!!"
16648005,175593170,2017-07-29,88602348,Tyra,"Byron's place was just adorable, and he was the perfect host! Accommodation is a comfy, cozy, impeccably designed room, perfect for a short stay in London. Byron went out of his way to give recommendations, to answer questions, and to make sure I had a comfortable stay. The private entrance is ideal, and I wish I had stayed longer so that I would've had time to enjoy the cute garden area. The neighborhood is residential and super close to public transportation as well as plenty of cafes, small restaurants, convenience stores, etc. If you're looking for something simple, cute, tidy, and convenient, I highly recommend Byron's!

16648005,178428360,2017-08-05,124937968,Christine,Byrons place Is small but cosy and perfect for a couple. The separated entrance was very convenient and the garden area was lovely!

Man gelangt echt gut mit Bus oder Bahn zur Unterkunft, es dauert zwar etwas länger auf Grund des Verkehrs aber die ruhige Lage ist wirklich toll. Außerdem gibt es ein paar Restaurants und Geschäfte dort in der Nähe.<br/>Wirklich empfehlenswert!"
16648005,244147478,2018-03-18,56108915,Hannah,"Lovely and clean place! Great location that is well connected to the rest of London, but still feels comfortable and homey."

16648005,248778711,2018-04-01,125119995,Pilar,"Totalmente recomendable. Byron y Lauren son muy simpáticos y muy buenos anfitriones. Nos recomendaron un restaurante de la zona que estaba genial la comida y de precio también. Está muy bien comunicado a través de estaciones de Overground, Metro y Bus. Llegamos desde el aeropuerto de Stansted cogiendo el bus de National Express hasta la parada de Finchley Road & Forgnal y luego un Overground hasta kensal Rise, nos dejó al lado del alojamiento.<br/>El desayuno es fenomenal, incluye fruta, cereales, galletas y una neverita para leche fresca o alguna cosa que compres y quieras mantener refrigerado.<br/>El baño está genial, muy limpio y la ducha es muy cómoda.<br/>Está en un barrio tranquilo. Lo recomiendo."
16648005,251160910,2018-04-07,102301874,Suci,"Byron’s place is marvelous! We stayed there for 5 nights and really satisfied. The location is very convenient with train station and bus stop a short walk away. Byron and Lauren were very welcoming and giving us all information needed. The room was very clean and well equipped. Light breakfast, coffee set and fridge were provided and we very much enjoyed the private entrance with a patio. We highly recommend their place!"
16648005,254291311,2018-04-16,169256565,Susan,"Byron and Lauren warmly welcomed us to their house. We stayed for 7 nights and especially liked the private entrance and private bathroom. The room was small but well-decorated with plants and strands of lights. The neighborhood was quiet and seemed safe.<br/>Byron and Lauren provided 3 types of cereal, pastries and fruit for breakfast, as well as tea and coffee. We appreciated the dish soap and sponge so we could wash the dishes. We also appreciated the fridge and the hair dryer.<br/>Their house is about a 15-minute walk to Queen’s Park underground and overground stations. We didn’t mind the walk too much unless it was rainy.<br/>We would have liked to have been able to use the washer, but I found a great laundromat close to Queen’s Park station."
16648005,255095494,2018-04-19,171616514,Margaret,Very pleasant host. Very handy for a short break in London.

16648005,264912521,2018-05-15,157597797,Selina,"Wir übernachteten 5 Nächte bei Byron und Lauren. Wie bereits erwähnt ist der Raum recht klein aber beinhaltet dennoch alles was man benötigt. Über Geschirr, zusätzliche Decken, Shampoo, Adapter und noch mehr wurde viel von Byron und Lauren bereitgestellt. Das Zimmer ist sehr liebevoll eingerichtet, nur leider ist das Bett ziemlich unbequem. Das ""Frühstück"" war für uns super, da wir dadurch doch noch einiges an Geld sparen konnten und man in dem kleinen Kühlschrank auch sonstige Lebensmittel für zwischendurch aufbewahren konnte. Die Wohnung ist gut an öffentliche Verkehrsmittel angebunden (Zone 2) und befindet sich nur einen Katzensprung entfernt von der Overground Station Kensal Rise. Auch ein paar Geschäfte und Lokale sind zu Fuß erreichbar. Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt in London und können das kleine Airbnb jedem empfehlen der preiswert in der Metropole Großbritanniens übernachten möchte. :)"
16648005,266498462,2018-05-20,80524668,Karoliina,Kohteen kuvaus vastasi hyvin majoitusta. Majoittaja oli erittäin ystävällinen ja hyvin tavoitettavissa.
16648005,268954774,2018-05-26,52901696,Mallory,Byron’s place was so clean and comfy! He kindly greeted us on arrival and gave us such great tips about getting around. His place also offered a simple breakfast that was just what we needed and also provided a cooler for any groceries we purchased. The private entrance was also so convenient and made it really feel like a private accommodation. Would 100% recommend this place and wish we could have stayed longer! 
16648005,270809763,2018-05-30,30346320,Karen,"The space is cozy, toilet is clean. Very quiet neighbourhood. Byron is very helpful to clean the kettle for me. Many eateries around and  supermarket is nearby."

16648005,276631664,2018-06-14,168774203,John,Byron and Lauren were very pleasant to chat with during our stay. Their place is within a convenient short walking distance of the London Overground.

16648005,294644941,2018-07-22,201773431,Sam,"Room is clean, practical and efficient (although it's not that big). Good shower! The patio is nice for some fresh air. In summer the room gets quite warm, but there is a fan available. Byron is a friendly host, who responds quick and helps you out the best way possible. Location is outside the city (less practical if you don't want to spend much time on transport/walking), but the room is situated in a beautiful borough where you can escape the hustle and bustle from the city. Room is very quiet, not much noice here. "
16648005,296648635,2018-07-26,25878800,Tanvi,"Byron and Lauren are extremely warm and welcoming hosts!  They were there to receive us when we arrived as well as to see us off the day we left. We absolutely loved their cosy ensuite with a private garden. It is beautifully styled and sparkling clean. It is also walking distance from the Kensal Rise tube station. There was cereal, fruits, cookies and delicious tea and coffee available to us for breakfast. We had an extremely comfortable stay and would love to visit them again!"

It's very well located, close to several modes of public transport and in a very nice neighbourhood (up and coming, as we learned just today) itself as well.<br/>The hosts, Byron and Lauren, are very kind and helpful and thoroughly deserve the ""predicate"" superhost!<br/><br/>Thank you both for a lovely time!"

16648005,317458641,2018-09-02,210878672,Kerstin,"Eine ideale Unterkunft für ein Wochenende in London. Klein aber mit allen notwendigen Dingen ausgestattet (Ein kleiner Kühlschrank, Föhn, sogar Shampoo und Duschgel, Adapter usw.) Es gab alles was man morgens braucht, einen guten Kaffee, ein kleines Frühstück und einen schönen Platz im Freien.<br/>Der Raum war sehr sauber und wunderschön dekoriert. Durch den separaten Eingang und das private Bad hatte man nie den Eindruck zu ""stören"". Die beiden waren wirklich supernette Gastgeber. Wir würden gerne wiederkommen."

16648005,322962396,2018-09-14,26923170,Kristine,Byron and his girlfriend were absolutely wonderful hosts! The space was absolutely beautiful and with the private entrance it really felt like our own place rather than a private room. There is a small cooler there (but no microwave) so we were able to store some food things away. This was my first time not getting a private place on Airbnb and I was impressed :) Much nicer than a hotel to be sure.
16648005,328188737,2018-09-25,32201724,Gouri,"Confortable, stylish little self-contained room with luxurious smelling towels and sheets, basic breakfast things and coffee, all toiletries. No issues with anything. Had a restful and peaceful stay. The separate entrance is just perfect. I missed a television at night but that's about the only first-world complaint ... Byron was super nice and helpful with eating out and transport suggestions. Highly recommend!"
16648005,331668881,2018-10-03,81769448,Joshua,"Byron and Lauren have a delightful place, in a great location.<br/>Prior to my arrival they gave me helpful instructions on how to make it to their place. Upon my arrival I was greeted by Byron (Lauren was away for work) and we had a nice chat, during which he gave me some handy tips on things to see and places to eat. <br/>The room itself is lovely, and has a comfortable bed and nicely appointed en-suite. Breakfast cereals, pastries, fruit, milk, and coffee and tea were provided, with cutlery and crockery; a small bar fridge is also provided. The private entrance is great and the little courtyard is nice for having breakfast in. <br/>All up, I was pleasantly impressed with my stay at Byron and Lauren’s and would definitely recommend others to stay there."

Although the homeowner arranged for an electrician to come out, it did leave us without a useable bedroom and kitchen, which was inconvenient seen as we were a group of 10 plus a baby. "

16909230,169360867,2017-07-12,125259789,Petrina,The house's location is really convenient and it was nice to experience living in a mews house. We were a group of 7 adults and 1 child and the space was more than enough for all of us. We had issues with the leaking bathroom on the highest floor. Cindy had alerted us about beforehand that the shower was not usable but we then discovered more leaks from the bathtub too. She was very prompt in responding when I notified her of the leak and we understand this will be a rather major job to be done and has been scheduled for a later date.
16909230,173270813,2017-07-23,117535486,Fengli,"The house is in good condition and the room is clean and suitable for several friends to live with.

The room was quiet and really cozy, the kitchen full with all the things you'd need to cook a nice dinner and the flat is just a few minutes away from a beautiful park. Ana was really friendly and helpful. Honestly, it was a super pleasant stay."
16968463,154231041,2017-05-23,11658673,Tiffany,"Ana was so accommodating and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. We were in town for a very last-minute trip and were lucky enough to have booked Ana's place. We are not new to London, but had not yet explored the area of her flat — and we're so happy we did! We spoke to some locals at a nearby Vietnamese restaurant, had the most delicious Colombian food, and enjoyed the street art as we made our way into central London each morning. The commute was super simple, too. Finally, Ana's flat has everything you could need while traveling. We did a load of laundry while we were there, which was a huge relief to us as we had been traveling for awhile and were about to run out of clean clothes. Ana's other guests, who were staying for a few months from Spain, were also extremely friendly and made us feel at home immediately. We would love to stay again!"
16968463,156769120,2017-06-01,20262771,Christina,"I have stayed in Anas apartment twice when in London with work and it has been a lovely stay both times.<br/><br/>The room: Bright, good size (big enough to do some yoga on the floor). A nice comfortable bed (although in my opinion, it would be a bit small for 2 adults, I think, but I do like my space when I sleep). A comfortable chair to sit and read in. There is a place to hang your clothes, and it is decorated in a way that makes it feel more like a home than a rental-apartment. <br/><br/>The apartment: Good clean bathroom facilities. The kitchen is equipped for basic simple cooking, there is both freezer and fridge and there even is a dolce gusto coffee machine available. There is a living room where you can eat your meals or relax in the couch.  The apartment is clean, it is not noisy and even though you share it with other guest(s), the bathroom is between the two rooms so you have plenty of privacy. <br/><br/>Location: 15-20 min walk from Denmark Hill overground (easy acces to GTW airport), 2-3 min walk to bus which takes you to central London. 10 min to Camberwell ""centre"" where there are nice cafes, restaurants etc. <br/><br/>Host: Really nice, friendly. Quick reply if you had a question. When I was here, the other guest had a few problems, and she came and fixed it straight away even though it was a bank holiday. I was allowed to come in earlier to leave my bags. Has made a REALLY THOROUGH guest book with all you need to know about the apartment, the area and London. <br/><br/>All in all I would highly recommend a stay in Anas apartment and I will come back for my next work-trip to London for sure.

Ana is a very lovely person and she always helped us when we needed something and gave us tips how to spend the weekend. She is really really nice. The flat was very pretty, clean and tidy. We shared it with a friendly couple from spain. The kitchen is small but we had everything we needed. The bathroom was very clean and everything in the house was very modern. We really loved our cosy room. Unfortunately there was no shelf or wardrobe for our clothes but a clothes rail with a few hangers and we only stayed a few days so that was no problem. In summer the flat can be very hot but we spend our days outside and have only been there for the night so that was fine.<br/>The busstops are a 3-10 min walk away and it's only 30 min to the city. We loved the bus trips cause it's so interesting to see the city all the different houses and you have a really good view when you sit 'upstairs' in the bus. ______ We really recommend this flat and couldn't imagine a better stay then in Ana's flat! Thanks for everything!"

16968463,179318022,2017-08-07,116100272,Jorg,"We spend 4 nights at Ana's flat (2 persons, me and my son). With Ana's instructions it was easy to find. It is about 15 minutes by bus from Underground station Elephant and Castle. Buses go continuously, day and night. The flat is very comfortable, clean and cosy. Everything you need is available and it is a haven of piece after strolling through the busy city during the day. Enough shops and restaurants within walking distance to get whatever you need, day or night. It offers excellent value for money! I'd go again when in London!"
16968463,183153309,2017-08-16,54158781,Antonia,"Very cosy and welcoming home. It is very clean and well maintained, it has every necessary for a wonderful stay. It was very easy to communicate with Anna, she is super friendly and a very nice person. Ana and her husband organized an amazing surprise dinner for us and it was lovely.<br/> I would love to visit again!"
16968463,186290608,2017-08-24,89792217,Marese,"We stayed in Ana's flat for 8 days. It was a good stay, in general, I would say. The location was great because it was accessible via bus. And there were nearby restaurants and convenience store. The size of the room was just right for 2 persons. Luggages could still fit inside. Ana was a good host! She would always check on us if we need help with anything. Thank you, Ana. We had a great time in your flat. Would recommend this for future travels in London. Cheers! :)"
16968463,188014626,2017-08-28,38073740,Alexia,Nice place nice bed nice bathroom nice kitchen ! Everything was Perfect!

She sent me everything I need on (Hidden by Airbnb) for example position, where I could find the key and how to use the house as best as I can. Lovely place, lovely host and clean and.. what can I write more? Anything. She's amazing and her house too. Thank you dear to host me, be sure if I would come to London I'll come there. Thank you so much! See u soon :3"
16968463,200751036,2017-10-06,49069482,Nadzirah,"I was traveling with my husband to London and we booked Ana's place for a total of 5 days and 4 nights. <br/><br/>Everything was just perfect! The house is such a cosy place with everything that you would expect to feel right at home. <br/> <br/>The entire house especially the toilet and bed are clean, comfortable and spacious. We shared the house with two separate guests during our stay there but there's enough room for everyone. We looked forward to a nights' rest after a long day out(:<br/><br/>Though it's not exactly in Central London but it's close enough via bus and underground (Elephant & Castle) & you get to see so much more of London that way. <br/><br/>We had so much fun at Ana's place and would definitely recommend to couples & solo travelers!"

Clean, it has everything you should need ans it's not far from city centre considering London is so big. 25 minutes by bus to get to the centre ( you have to walk a little too) and you can also find parking spaces down the street!"
16968463,212548476,2017-11-18,103025487,Solène,Super appartement. Très propre et très bien décoré. Il est légèrement excentré mais très bien desservi !

16968463,217254561,2017-12-08,154822610,Laura,Very stylish clean and organised. Ana has thought of everything to make your home away from home work... the little things like tea coffee and sugar in the pantry so you can make a quick cuppa on arrival.<br/>The beautiful handwritten book that she has left for guests with her personal tips and advice in are second to none! <br/>As far as hosts go Ana has it all sewn up...<br/>It was a delight to stay here and we would most definitely stay again in the future...<br/>Thank you Ana
16968463,226752281,2018-01-12,46475638,Evie,"Ana's place was fantastic. The self check-in process was straightforward and Ana made the instructions very clear before arrival so there was no problem. Although we didn't actually meet her during the stay, I was in contact with Ana throughout and she always responded straight away. Nothing seemed to be a bother for her. The whole flat was spotless, the kitchen was well equipped and the bedroom a good size. I love Ana's style; the flat is full of nice wee decorative touches without being cluttered. The area is calm and there's a bus stop not far from the flat which is handy. All in all we really enjoyed our stay and can highly recommend!"

16968463,228155249,2018-01-18,60532680,Jennifer-Jayne,"Ana was SO informative and helpful through my whole stay. <br/>Videos to help me “self check-in” - keys, heating, WiFi, finding the place... it was super easy!!<br/>The place is gorgeous. So many cute touches that make it feel like home.<br/>I would stay here again in a heart beat (so much so that I even asked to move in!!)<br/>Thank you so much Ana. X"
16968463,229754814,2018-01-25,153638025,Ali,This place is a good choice for couples who want to stay near the heart of London for a short or long stay.  Thanks Ana for her hospitality and kindness.

Recomendo a todos! • Très bonne localisation, l'appart offre tout ce dont vous avez besoin, Il est propre et confortable. Ana nous a très bien accueilli, sympa et disponible. Je recommande à tous!"
16968463,250241462,2018-04-04,53252949,Sabrina,"Anas Unterkunft war sehr schön! Die Lage ist ruhig, man bekommt vom Trubel Londons wenig mit, was wir sehr angenehm fanden. Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und Bushaltestellen waren in nächster Umgebung, alles schnell zu erreichen. Die Wohnung ist schön eingerichtet und sauber, wir würden es jederzeit weiter empfehlen, dort zu übernachten. Ana war super hilfsbereit und immer für uns zu erreichen! Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen!"
16968463,252400828,2018-04-10,15522777,Charlotte,"Everything was super nice in Anas Apartment. Clean, comfy and cute furnishing. Our room was spacious and quiet, although you hear other people in the house sometimes. The place might be not right in the middle of the center of London, but because of that, we got to know a really nice and vibrant neighborhood. A lot of awesome pubs, cafes, shops  and many busstops nearby! We saw Ana just for a short moment, but she was a really friendly and caring host and answered our questions via phone immediately. Thanks for the nice stay!"
16968463,254342482,2018-04-16,15272672,Emely,"Really nice appartement and great host. Great restaurant tipps and really fast responses. Thank you for the great time, really recommend!"

16968463,259555666,2018-05-01,44754939,Julia,"Ana’s Place is absolutely perfect and Ana herself is so cool. The location is a bit far from the center, but so accessible by bus and tube that it doesn’t even matter. The apartment is clean and very cute. Ana went above and beyond to make sure we could check-in okay (her instructions even come with helpful videos!) and was great at communicating the whole trip. Thanks again for everything, Ana!"
16968463,268956740,2018-05-26,183212557,Annette,Ana's place is very nice and clean. She was very thoughtful and made sure that we had all the info we needed to check in and out.

16968463,301375977,2018-08-04,154491654,Laura,"We had a nice stay at Ana's nice decorated place. The bus connection was also good. In the kitchen one can find a book with local tips and attractions. <br/>The only issue were the other guests regarding the tidiness of the common areas, but that's not Ana's fault.<br/>All in all it was a great stay and I'd recommend the place."
16968463,307467092,2018-08-14,54836672,Siddharth,"Large, comfy room. Easy access to washer and dryer, which was greatly appreciated. Our host also sent through a number of helpful videos to guide us to access the space, and although we were sharing the apartment with other guests, the space felt fairly private. Just a heads up if you're carrying substantial luggage - the stairs to the apartment were a little steep/narrow. Other than that, a great experience."
16968463,310064561,2018-08-19,180661642,Amber,"A very lovely apartment. It's really well decorated which makes you feel at home immediately. The apartment itself isn't in a very nice neighbourhood but there are multiple bus stops close by so it's very easy to reach the city centre. The host responded very quickly and was very helpful. A great place to stay, would recommend. "
16968463,313977531,2018-08-26,197094843,Maximilian,"Everything is as described. Like others already mentioned, the only thing is that you need some time to the inner city. All in all Ana was a great host! She frequently asked if everything is allright and responded quickly if we had any questions."
16968463,318701117,2018-09-04,24490584,Tatyana,Ana was awesome!! She left a very thoughtful book with tips and spots to check out! Responded very fast and left detailed info for us. Her home was very clean and charming. Overall we loved our stay!

16968463,324636541,2018-09-17,14533965,Jonathan,Ana's place was great!  Easy to find and access with reasonable proximity to local food and transit.  Definitely a good spot to stay in London.

16968463,351322132,2018-11-22,210865770,Xi,Ana是非常好的房东，认真负责，会详细的告诉地址，用视频拍下发给我们，回复非常迅速。整栋房子看起来是精心装修的，很多细节都做得非常完美。厨房可以做饭，但是做完后一定要把厨房洗干净。需要走8-10分钟到车站，不用担心找不到地方和怎么走，谷歌地图会详细的告诉你的。如果还有机会来英国，我一定会在这里连续住十天，性价比很高！这次在这边住的五天。然后要来英国的朋友一定要自备拖鞋。谢谢Ana！我在床头留有几颗糖，不知道你能不能吃到。
16968463,353266725,2018-11-27,211456613,Marianne,"Ana is such an amazing host! So very kind, organized and really good at communication, and she did everything she could to make it an awsome stay."

There was excellent communication and clear instructions for check in, and the flat was absolutely lovely - very clean and nicely decorated, super comfortable with all the amenities you would need and easy transport links to the centre of London! I very much enjoyed my stay  here and would definitely recommend it to others!"
16968463,400240916,2019-01-11,160604808,Céline,L’appartement de Ana est propre et très bien décoré. J’ai adoré cet endroit et Ana est très gentille et attentionnée. Je recommande absolument cet appartement malgré le fait qu’il soit un peu éloigné.

16968463,404225156,2019-01-23,3074137,Adrian,"Having just come from another Airbnb flat the size of a shoebox, Ana's place seemed very spacious indeed.  I loved the decor and all the little touches, like the tile stickers on the stairs and in the bathroom, and especially her hand-written guide book. All the appliances were in excellent order and the heating so easy to use. Ana's communication was excellent and even though I let myself in there was no confusion as she'd given me so many instructions - so MANY instructions! She came round once and was very friendly and helpful. I also liked the set-up - having other people staying in another room, and seeing them in the kitchen - it was like a flatshare and, being on my own, I appreciated the company. Camberwell is a good area, so central and fairly quiet - except for the fox shrieking in the night!"
16968463,407192791,2019-02-01,66122442,Hannah,Ana’s place in Camberwell was a great place to stay whilst I was setting up my life in London. The place is clean and spacious and well connected to buses. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. The room and house is very well secured and safe. The only thing I would have liked was there to be a coffee shop close by but that is just a personal preference and it is only a 10 minute walk to Camberwell high street  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Sydney. Oh and Lastly Ana is a fabulous host! Very easy to communicate with and on hand for any problems you may encounter. Thankyou Ana!
16968463,413170363,2019-02-17,21276164,Enni,"Ana's place is really nice, clean, fresh and everything works well. My room was quiet and bed was comfortable.

I also loved the interior and decoration of the flat. <br/>It‘s not central but there are several bus stops nearby that take you directly to the city centre. Overall I really enjoyed my stay here. <br/>Ana was very helpful and answered every question I had."

16968463,481708640,2019-07-05,26768474,Xiaowei,"It was my first time to London and I was a little nervous at first. But when I got to Ana’s flat, I felt safe and relaxed. Ana sent me a lot of information in advance, and although I had some trouble when I first checked in, Ana quickly responded and helped me a lot. Ana's flat was clean and tidy, beautifully decorated, with a perfect kitchen. There are buses near the flat and access to the subway station nearby. It's quiet here at night and good for rest. I like it very much! Thanks Ana for her patient guidance and kindness."
16968463,483085290,2019-07-07,187246447,Charlotte,"There isn’t much I can say about Ana’s place because it met all exceptions! The room was very well decorated and practical, the neighborhood is quiet and Ana was a great host and responded very quickly to our questions and our issues. The apartment is a bit far from central London but the closest bus stop is 3-5 minutes away from the apartment and makes it very easy to go to the underground. This is overall a great place that I would completely recommend!"

16968463,532692305,2019-09-20,138067212,Mari,I really enjoyed staying her place. Very clean and comfortable. Exactly same as pictures and quick responses. Very easy to check in!
16968463,535435659,2019-09-24,273451637,Tereza,"It was very lovely place to stay in London! The flat was clean and comfortable and had everything needed, also is very stylish. The place is located near bus stop and shops. Great communication, Ana responded always really quickly."
16968463,555093136,2019-10-27,78333662,Andrea,"We spent 3 nights at Ana's apartment. The location is not faraway from the city and the bus from Elephant& Castle comes like every 10 min. It's a quiet area. The check-in is very sofitsticated but Ana provided us with helpful instructions and videos so that (almost) everything was clear and easy to follow. The rooms are tidy and stylish, the bathroom is very clean and kitchen has all the appliances you'll need for the best comfort. We did not have enough time to explore that part of London, so we bought our food in the city. Anytime we had any questions, we reached Ana via phone and she kindly helped us. We would come again. Highly recommanded!"
16968463,559615544,2019-11-04,30119124,Sophie,"Stylish space, clean and tidy, great location for central London! Ana was also quick at responding and detailed check in!"
16968463,560581583,2019-11-07,11782176,Veronika,"Can recommend Ana’s place! Clean, spacious, stylish and has everything you need. I did not have issues finding it; the street is quite and i felt safe returning home late."
16968463,562702593,2019-11-11,176058750,Hermanni,"Ana's place was very stylish, well kept and had everything you needed for a stay in London."
16968463,564665270,2019-11-16,74456283,Pablo Miguel,"It’s a good place to stay, very well located"
16968463,568235748,2019-11-24,109748158,Konstantin,One of the best Airbnb’s I ever stayed at. Ana provides instructions how to get to her place as well as checks in during your stay. Not far away from bus stops and stores. Great stay.
16968463,574545148,2019-12-08,67859682,Ida,"Nice place, close to bus stations and easy to get in to town. Close to a supermarket if you want to eat breakfast in her cute little kitchen. <br/>Very fresh and clean house!"
16968463,578297936,2019-12-17,259778182,Ranuli,"Quite a great place. Cosy and stylish. Reliable host. A bit far off from any tube station, but you’ll soon get familiar around. It has a great kitchen, where you can cook your own meals. Would highly recommend."
16968463,579324849,2019-12-20,161063045,Yuichi,It was great staying at a clean house.
16968463,581240011,2019-12-24,153058558,Joselito,Really nice place... a haven just a few minutes from city center.
16968463,583872034,2019-12-29,200842795,Clément,"Perfect place to visit London. Ana is really nice and it's easy to communicate. We had a wonderful stay, I recommend "
16968463,594936146,2020-01-19,321307256,Mackenzie,Ana had such a lovely place for our weekend trip to London! It had all the amenities we needed. It was super cute and clean!
16968463,597327412,2020-01-25,37127188,Missy,"Check in was super easy. And the self check in gave me so much freedom. Ana leaves exact step by step instructions and includes videos, which makes it so simple. <br/>The place was perfectly clean and super cozy. The apartment had literally everything I needed. Even found a plug converter in the drawer when I realized I forgot mine. Ana was available for any issues. <br/>Also the location was great. Just a bus (or about a 25 min walk) to the tube. And from there just a few minutes to the city. <br/>I was really happy about my stay. Will definitely try to book here my next time in London. ❤️"
16968463,607935566,2020-02-19,40219698,Oliver,"Ana is extremely well organised when it comes to confirming your booking and clearly communicating all the information you could need about the property, local area and transport links.<br/><br/>The property itself is homely, comfortable, clean and secure. I would definitely stay again.<br/><br/>Be prepared to walk or catch the bus to get around as the nearest tube station is a little distance away. Regular buses connecting to central London can be taken from just around the corner from the property."
17274811,133261700,2017-02-21,5299127,Ignatius,Very clean and comfortable rooms and bathroom.  I will definitely like to stay there more often

17274811,136840824,2017-03-12,44611078,Tomáš,Great accomodation. Cool location not so far to the city centre. Good prices and great beer in The Windmill pub.

17274811,147391000,2017-04-26,3362595,Elizabeth,"Good location, nice host"
17274811,147688311,2017-04-28,65013101,Rebecca,"The room was perfect for an overnight stay in London in a brilliant location! Gerry was kind in allowing us a late check in and we particularly appreciated his allowing us to leave our car at the property for the day. The room was all we needed and the shower facilities were great. The bed was a little springy and the room quite light but for the amazing price and generous hosts, we certainly weren't complaining! Would definitely stay again."
17274811,147931240,2017-04-29,56021900,Sarah,Affordable accommodation and very friendly stuff!
17274811,149305513,2017-05-03,56188569,Kavita,"It was a great and simple place to live in, very accessible to the tube and central London. We had a comfortable stay and had no trouble using the bathrooms as and when needed though it was shared. Gerry was a great host and checked on us to see if everything was going fine, would love to be back here!"
17274811,149692289,2017-05-05,4218742,Jacinthe,"Basic but great: Bathroom is outside the room and shared but really clean and nice shower. Cold room, no isolation so you hear everything outside and in other rooms. But once again plenty of space and really nice bed so I guess it is great for the value and a short stay. Breakfast included is a good thing as well."
17274811,150573084,2017-05-08,101947481,Balatonyi,Its was Just Perfect for a short stay. 
17274811,151192751,2017-05-11,96697585,Dongxia (Ray),Value for money 
17274811,152236223,2017-05-15,66291142,Patrick,Gerry is a very nice host!!!<br/>The room is above a Pub and it's more like a guesthouse.<br/>
17274811,152604711,2017-05-17,130316447,Victor,The place is really well locats and its the perfect place for a musician in an adventure is close to many bus stops and close to acton town station 
17274811,153476447,2017-05-21,24192027,Agata,"The room is ok, clean and pretty big, in an old building. Unfortunately the windows don't have enough covering curtains and in the morning the light in the room is very disturbing! The bed is very comfortable and the toilets are clean. The plugs and the wifi don't work really well. The breakfast is small but enough ( coffe, tea, milk, cereals, bread, butter and jam).<br/>The location is really far away from London Central, close to a train station but still very far!!<br/>We haven't meet Gerry but the staff it's been very friendly and helpful.  <br/><br/>"
17274811,157266765,2017-06-03,36978809,Stephen,You get what you pay for. The room above the windmill was cheap as were the accommodations. There was a blanket but no sheets and the night we stayed it was really warm in the room. No AC and no fan to cool us down. The wifi was spotty and the street noise was super loud. I wouldn't stay again...but it was cheap and that's what we wanted
17274811,162355448,2017-06-20,43705015,Kellyann,"This was a last minute booking and Gerry was very helpful, he also offered an early breakfast. The shower was nice and powerful and many restaurants just a few steps from the accommodation. All the best. "
17274811,186421054,2017-08-24,41444484,Vincent,"Excellent quality-price ratio, would come again."
17274811,188488217,2017-08-29,105706712,Delphine-Jeanne,Pleasant stay
17274811,194756879,2017-09-17,88411900,Carmelo,"Gerry was a very welcoming host along with all the staff there. The. accommodation was excellent for the two weeks we stayed and for the price you pay. We had a fair bit of storage with us with Gerry letting us store it in the back garage, locked up securely for as long as needed. The communal shower and toilet was cleaned everyday with the bin in the room emptied also. Come weekend if keen for a beer, the pub is downstairs but if having a quiet one indoors then you still cannot hear noise from the pub which was great!. Highly recommended and thanks again."
17274811,197394992,2017-09-25,69332094,Zuzanna,"Good place for reasonable prize. Quiet, nice room with breakfast included. Gerry was very helpful and friendly, he gives all the information about the city and the transport. The windmill is located close to bus stop and the tube. I highly recommend."
17274811,199129524,2017-10-01,120865056,Ladislav,"Great pub, nice hospitality, Price vs Value"
17274811,199618057,2017-10-02,136105413,Isabelle,Perfect for our short stay in London. Close to multiple busses and above a lovely pub
17274811,201053763,2017-10-07,4070312,Jade,Pros: 5 minute walk to the Underground. Good area. Clean place. Towels included (to use). Free continental breakfast.<br/>Cons: Street noise. Female staff at bar completely trying to ignore you when trying to check in (although they knew exactly what time we were coming). Note: downstairs is a restaurant/bar.<br/>Overall I would recommend. Perhaps the bartender was having a bad day?
17274811,202186715,2017-10-10,40765354,Grant,A great place to stay! Would highly recommend!
17274811,202692915,2017-10-12,147738293,Martin,Unique place with great accommodation and close to down town!

17274811,204480706,2017-10-18,121396226,Zsuzsa,"The windmill is right next a very noisy main road.<br/>Only one bathroom and one toilet (both are shared) for 4 rooms!<br/>The breakfast is basic,toast,jam,instant cafe ,English breakfast tea and cereal with milk.<br/>Very close to buses which goes to the tube station/train station."
17274811,206589653,2017-10-26,109160988,Josh,"Good place to stay. It's described as budget accommodation and that is what it is, a cheap clean place to stay. "

Gerry is a very nice host, he recommended nice places to visit and took care of me while I had the flu. The rooms are spacious and confortable. We had a very pleasant stay, will probably come back.<br/>I recommend !!"

17274811,230186245,2018-01-27,27502109,Patrick,"Great hospitality. Clean. It’s above the pub, The Windmill. We absolutely loved the food at The Windmill (the best we had in London). "

17274811,252869164,2018-04-12,163053868,Jingchun,我猜airbnb是Mr Gerry众多业务之一，地理位置还不错也很容易找到，可是床单上的两根短头发和卫生间地板上的纸会觉得很不舒服，房间里没有什么可用的东西。早餐就是牛奶的面包，在楼下餐厅八点半才开始，之前没有，对需要较早出行的人很不方便，房间内不允许带入食物，不知道是否包括一切食物，因为我们晚上很晚到达，早晨很早出门没有在房间吃东西。外面就是马路，晚上车呼啸而过时我就会醒来，加上淡黄色窗帘总让我以为天亮了，对睡眠比较轻的人不是很好的选择。
17274811,257258423,2018-04-25,132100166,Matt,Nice honest place to stay near good public transport
17274811,264022049,2018-05-13,180954538,Paula Andrea,"El lugar es limpio,el desayuno basico.  la gran contra es que no esta en zona centrica. y para llegar al metro tenes que tomar un bus y te lleva mas tiempo y dinero."
17274811,265499439,2018-05-17,182797219,Robert,"Room 4 was large, clean and sunny with comfortable bed. Very handy for bus to Hammersmith Hospital."
17274811,268270518,2018-05-24,52918622,Lai Fan,旅館交通算方便，往市區景點只須半小時車程，房間很大喼方便打開，早餐簡單但可以接受，以平的價格住宿可以接受.
17274811,269287033,2018-05-27,19692251,Guillermo Ivan,"Great location, close to city centre and Heathrow by subway. Clean and comfortable. Great staff."
17274811,278563396,2018-06-18,1374688,Elin,"I recommend that everyone check out Gerrys place. The room was better than seen in pictures, super clean, nice, and quiet. Even though there is a pub downstairs (that serves wonderful food, by the way) you wouldn't know when you're in the room - it's very well soundproofed. There is a busy street outside but thanks to the double glazed (I assume?) windows it's barely noticeable. Wonderful place, will definitely stay again if I need a weekend place in London!"
17274811,279970443,2018-06-22,15980942,Hayley,"We wanted a place to stay so we could get to Heathrow, and this place was perfect! Clean bed and bathroom. It is nothing fancy, but for the price I don’t think you can beat it in the London area. Good breakfast, and a nice pub to have a drink at. If I needed to stay near heathrow again I would definitely check here first."
17274811,283723012,2018-06-30,133235711,Getter,"Nice place to stay, the room was nice. Toilet and bathroom are shared with other rooms. Not so close to the centre of the city but transportation is good. Hosts are really lovely and downstairs they have a bar, its really  cool. Stayed there only one night but would come back anytime"
17274811,286828953,2018-07-07,180859474,Yen Chen,離交通工具很近，房東人很好，有什麼問題跟房東反應都會得到解答，每天都有早餐，附近也有很多商店
17274811,288711675,2018-07-10,195068441,Jocelyne,"The place is so nice and Gerry is a very kind man . Helping us a lot .  The first night waiting for us to check in after the midnight due to the long line by passing the immigration officers in the airport, then providing us a  Chinese adapter which can help us to use Chinese hair dryer . Thanks so much ,Gerry . If we have time to come back London , we will book your room again."
17274811,289024953,2018-07-11,6051232,Idellee,"Of the four BnBs we stayed in during our short trip overseas, Gerry’s place was my partner’s favorite. It’s on the third floor of his pub, and it’s an adorably quaint quintessential English room. Check in was easy, everything was clean and as described. WiFi signal was great. We didn’t spend much time in the room, and I would have loved to have enjoyed a pint downstairs, but unfortunately there were service issues on the Tube and we were late getting back, after closing hours. Next time. We chose Gerry’s place due to its proximity to LHR, and it was extremely easy getting on the Piccadilly line to the airport during the wee hours of the early morning. Super easy check out too. I’d hope to stay here again"
17274811,292210105,2018-07-17,119258113,静远,That is great for short stay. A little bit noise living near the windows.
17274811,294461653,2018-07-22,74906643,Denise,"This place worked perfectly for our family (couple and 6ys old daughter). The rooms are exactly as shown. Sharing toilets and shower was not an issue because they were rarely occupied besides being always clean. Everyone there were very kind and helpful. Near small restaurants, fast food, and transport to everywhere (Bus and Train).  We will definitely come back!"
17274811,296735123,2018-07-26,203688205,Charlotte,"The check in process was very fast and efficient and Gerry went an extra mile to extend the stay. The room is in a good location and great size for one person but during the summer months it’s extremely hot as there is no aircon or fan provided. Nevertheless, I would recommend "
17274811,297689461,2018-07-28,74906643,Denise,Perfect localuzation between Heatrow and City Centre...very easy to go everywhere.. there are maps for guests...the breakfast is good enough to begin the day! Gerry and everyone there is very gentle. Sharing the bathroom and toilet was ok because it was always clean and rarely occupied. Good neighborhood.
17274811,300030258,2018-08-01,190489624,Jennifer,"The Windmill offers great value, great location and great hospitality. Gerry and his wife are so friendly and welcoming. They couldn't do enough to help. Would definitely stay again!"
17274811,300954334,2018-08-03,74906643,Denise,"no doubt is the best option for low budget in London. The hospitality and the assistance for travelers are incredible. We definitely have a place to stay in London. Until 9pm there is on-site restaurant with good prices and then only PUB, then there are still good and cheap places around.  We are a family with one 6 years-old daughter and everything was perfect!"
17274811,301568177,2018-08-04,191586670,Chien-Hung,good position and good prize

17274811,319131105,2018-09-05,153840053,Raj,Jerry was a very friendly person who welcomed with a big smile. The room itself is very comfortable with all amenities that you will need. Toilets are shared but are very well maintained and clean.
17274811,320679403,2018-09-09,101037966,Susanne,Well worth the money! Really happy we got to check in after 11 pm as we had a late flight. It was quiet and easy to navigate to the city centre from the location. However we didn't get to benefit from the included breakfast as there were no one present when we got there in the morning. (This was within the hours we had been told there would be breakfast served) Would also like a larger bath towel as the ones we got were clearly hand towels :)
17274811,321457714,2018-09-10,9578443,Stephan,Convenient when you come from Heathrow. Nice room.
17274811,322937271,2018-09-14,111636058,Aisha,"Overall we had a good stay. The room is a great size and nice & private. Unfortunately the shower upstairs was broken so we had to go downstairs through the back of the pub to use the shower and on one day both showers were broke. Other than that, it was a nice place!"
17274811,326093502,2018-09-21,202110779,Liam,Saw some reviews on yelp that were less than complimentary but the place was sparkling and he shower was amazing. Great value

17274811,332886324,2018-10-06,105527,Norm,"Not expensive, but loud from street and adjacent rooms just from people talking"

17274811,345554181,2018-11-05,71106557,Nina,"In terms of accommodation, it was as expected!"
17274811,346089215,2018-11-07,133381921,Saverio,So the place is an accommodation of the bar. The room was big enough. With cleaning service every day. Breakfast was continental. Overall nice place to stay for the price.
17274811,347470732,2018-11-11,220002664,Souhila,FAUTV savoir qu' on loin du cadre familial qu' on décrit dans l annonce.des employée pressées et une chambre qui partage les toilettes et la douche sur le palier !!! La chambre était froide mon fils avait très froid car le chauffage ne marchait pas j ai demandé puis insisté   qu' on le vérifie donc il est en panne .On nous donné des couvertures supplémentaires!!! Alors qu' il y avait des chambres vides sur le palier  Heureusement que mon séjour était court !
17274811,351069647,2018-11-21,79308435,Laura,"Simple, clean and comfortable accommodation with a friendly host"
17274811,356904924,2018-12-09,194897933,Lesya,Everything was good besides the ice water in shower.
17274811,359568474,2018-12-17,46871495,David,Basic accommodation but very clean and a continental breakfast. Location was great for both central London and Heathrow was only £1.50 on the tube . Room price was reasonable
17274811,362876259,2018-12-27,36282948,Stefan,Great value with very friendly staff. Only thing I'd suggest is making the room to bathroom  ratio  more clear in the description. I think it was something like 10 rooms to 2 bathrooms. That felt a bit more like a hostel than an Airbnb so definitely something I think should be clear in the description.
17274811,365472693,2019-01-01,103907883,Brooks And Mariah,"The Airbnb is a good price for London, however there is not much to do in Acton and it is a 15 min walk to get to the tube that takes you anywhere else. <br/><br/>There is no pool or gym as listed in the amendities. I asked about these before our stay and received no response from the host. <br/><br/>We arrived when the pub was having their sat night live music which was a loud surprise. After much confusion a bartender was able to check our reservations and give us a key. <br/><br/>The rooms do no have their own bathrooms. The rooms have a bed table and chair, and the comforters are very warm. The breakfast consists of cereal, toast, jam, juice, and hot water for instant coffee, tea, or hot coco mix. <br/><br/>These are just things that I wish I knew before arriving and I hope it is helpful."
17274811,368107392,2019-01-06,215063774,Ian,Handy budget accommodation in west London

17274811,409998197,2019-02-09,66529360,Bohdana,"Vše bylo naprosto v pořádku. Hezky popsané místo, takže jsme vše snadno našli. Bohužel nefungovalo topení, ale byl poskytnut externí přímotop, takže palec nahoru. Snídaně standartní, ale mile překvapila. Pokoje čisté, dokonce každý den na pokoji uklizeno. Moc děkujeme :)"
17274811,418913821,2019-03-03,233293540,Billy,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

17274811,423791846,2019-03-15,211754582,Sheldon,"Very clean, comfortable room above The Windmill. Bathroom and toilets are shared although they were always clean. I got a lovely surprise when I saw the monsoon shower, plus always hot water. <br/>Excellent location for transport links, bus stops near door."
17274811,424755738,2019-03-17,30661221,Chris,"This was a clean, efficiently run place with friendly staff - great value all round. Shared toilets and shower but at this price we were OK with that. Breakfast is thrown in too - toast/cornflakes/hot drinks/juice so that's a plus. WiFi worked fine. All good!"
17274811,432294618,2019-04-03,164765834,Kyle,"Flexable check in , perfect stay"

17274811,451730030,2019-05-12,63780816,Ivana,"This is a fine budget room in London. It's clean and there are restaurants, fast-foods... in the area. The underground station 15-20 mins walking. The bed could be comfier. We stayed 2 nights and it was okay. The breakfast is casual."
17274811,452948620,2019-05-14,224295631,Brodie,"Good spot, large bed & large bedroom. Staff all very friendly and helpful. good place to stay for a quick trip! Would recommend!"
17274811,455170523,2019-05-19,198145344,Natália,Highly recommended
17274811,460105024,2019-05-28,62083670,Céleste,Our week-end at Gary’s airbnb was really great ! You sould try!
17274811,460424742,2019-05-29,71345760,Johann,All was good
17274811,461261829,2019-05-31,261841636,Mansi,"It was terrible experience even after we had paid extra high amount for 2 nights, although location was good but it was pointless due to home experience. We had to go to ground floor from second floor to ask for toilet paper, once it got finished. Also among 6 rooms ( around 12 guests) , there was only 1 toilet and 1 bathroom for which we had to wait in a queue. House felt little unsafe as we had noticed that, exit door was clearly accessible by visitors. Breakfast was incomplete as one day we didn’t get butter another day we couldn’t find spoon."
17274811,467862881,2019-06-11,27930889,Jasmin,"It was okay to stay there for a short trip to explore London. Acton is about 30 minutes away and the tube station is like a 15 minutes walk from the accommodation. However, I would not recommend it to other people. Bathroom and toilet are shared with other people which is not a big deal actually, but it wasn't that clean. It was also really noisy at night, you could hear the cars from the street as if they were right beside you, can't really understand all the other reviews by the other people. Also some of the other guests were being quite noisy, the first night I couldn't find sleep as someone was rumbling above us until the middle of the night. The bed was quite uncomfortable and the mattress really hard, my whole body was aching in the morning. Didn't eat breakfast there so I can't judge that, the pub looked lovely though. Staff was also very friendly. All in all it was fair for the price, but I wouldn’t stay there again."
17274811,468433294,2019-06-12,201805852,Verlin,Nice place to stay!
17274811,468864454,2019-06-13,123308782,Maureen,Really good
17274811,469200377,2019-06-14,144060370,Anja,"Great place to stay if you ‘re on a budget and don’t mind sharing a bathroom. Our room and the shared bathroom/toilet were really clean. The staff are lovely! It’s excellent value for money, so what’s not to like? :)"
17274811,469811840,2019-06-15,233173426,Andrea,Room was clean and comfortable.but shower and toilet is separate.but clean

17274811,476401619,2019-06-26,16415835,Alessandro,"Located very centrally in Acton with many shops, restaurants, supermarkets around. Only 10mins walk from Acton Town tube station and 25 mins ride if you need to catch a flight from Heathrow airport. Place very clean and quiet and nice people trying to help with my requests. Would recommend for a few days visiting London. Thank you."
17274811,478930297,2019-06-30,12448318,Stephanie,"Emily’s place is above the pub. Though so, it was quiet in our room eventhough it was also facing the main road. We appreciate that we could leave our bags at the place when we arrived earlier and later when we checked out. The place including the shower and toilets were clean and as shown in the pictures. A nice touch to this place is breakfast is included. The location is convenient to tourist sites, Westfield and to Heathrow. We recommend this place."
17274811,482256170,2019-07-06,261857056,Milán,"Remek házigazda. A szoba hatalmas, a reggeli pedig bőséges volt. Elhelyezkedése kiváló. Csak ajánlani tudom. Köszönjük!!!"
17274811,484200914,2019-07-08,192817109,Hoang Mai,"We had a short stay, the rooms and breakfast were better than expected. Only negative aspect is that you have to share bathrooms and restrooms with the other guests."

17274811,500001888,2019-08-01,262247155,Alessia,"Preis-Leistung passt super. Das Frühstück war für uns immer etwas zu spät (9:00), da wir einige Sehenswürdigkeiten etc. schon morgens um 10:00 gebucht hatten. <br/>Lage zwar etwas ausserhalb, aber man erreicht das Zentrum von London in 30/40 Minuten. <br/>Von Heathrow Airport mit dem Zug (Acton Main Line) retour für 15£ pro Person."
17274811,503686421,2019-08-06,273129374,Teresa,"The whole place was very clean, the location was convenient with easy access to busses and trains and the hospitality was wonderful.   We might reserve it again on our next trip."

Getting there took about 45min from the centre (underground + bus). I would've hoped for quicker replys from the host and clearer information concerning check-in, but in the end everything was ok."
17274811,512522953,2019-08-18,162870449,Geyuan,"Really a good deal! Cheap, but well-rounded facilities and breakfast as well. The location is next to the bar, and the room is quite clean.  Emily is so considerate and helpful with the check-in and prepared breakfast. Thank you so much."
17274811,514604022,2019-08-21,273788331,Kai,"Das Zimmer entsprach ganz unseren Erwartungen. Wer einen leichten Schlaf hat, wird mit den Verkehrsgeräuschen seinen wahre Freude haben, uns hat es aber nicht gestört.<br/>Bad/Dusche sowie Toilette befinden sich auf dem Flur, waren aber immer sauber. Das Personal war außerordentlich freundlich und hilfsbereit.<br/>Im Pub war es sehr gemütlich, dass Essen war super."
17274811,518800581,2019-08-27,101976792,Lisa,The bnb is good for a night's stay. The host was very accommodating with our late evening check in. Spacious room though the mattress and pillows could do with being renewed.

17274811,544590585,2019-10-10,26224248,Tom,The booking was cancelled a few hours before we were due to arrive because of  being double booked. We were also informed that the room was damaged with water. So a review of this property is impossible to give.

However, the adverstising let us think that the bathroom and toilets were inside the room but they are shared with other rooms. <br/>Anyway, we had an amazing time in London. The place is really good for people that want to visit the city during 3 or 4 days."

17274811,591958496,2020-01-12,150815545,Izabela,Overall the experience was very good. One minus is that the windows were locked so we couldn’t get any fresh air but we had a fan so it was fine.

17274811,751186672,2021-04-23,127733918,Anna,"It was all good, clean and spacious room, good value for price. Second night someone in the room next door was talking on the phone or I don't know - was playing a computer game? For a couple of hours, until 1am and I could hear every single word... at least they had nice British cockney accent, like in Eastenders so it enhanced my London experience."
17274811,753240787,2021-04-30,295335030,Dean,"Good location, good price, bathroom was good but bedroom needs to be cleaner."
17274811,764233252,2021-05-30,61535476,Stanislav,Nice place to stay. Location is great. Cleaned daily and wifi/ internet was superb!
17274811,766121010,2021-06-04,304876527,Larissa,I had a lovely short stay. The team was very nice and helpful. A huge plus: I could bring my bike and store it securely.

17274811,452007677203830803,2021-09-15,419511920,Anne,"The room itself was good, quiet and with a lot of space. It felt safe even though there are many other people with rooms at the pub.<br/>However, it could be clearer that the bathroom is shared with all the other guests, and not in the best state. It was adequate for the few days I was there, but I wouldn't recommend it for a longer stay."

17296930,159481283,2017-06-11,19055067,Jo,We were upgraded for free to Unit 1 as Unit 2 was double booked. The flat was lovely and well equipped with comfy beds. Great location. The food and milk etc left by Branca was a really nice touch. The brunch at Barber and Parlour opposite was divine. 
17296930,294032152,2018-07-21,11346504,Aaron,"A very cool, comfortable loft space for a reasonable price in Shoreditch "
17296930,472350123,2019-06-19,3458430,Jessica,"This flat was great! Perfect and cozy and in a fantastic location! I’d stay here again in a heart beat. <br/><br/>Branca, our host was very responsive and helpful and the flat was clean and welcoming. Flats like these are what make Airbnb a better option than your run of the mill hotel!"
17296930,502213918,2019-08-04,13258,Bruno,The flat is perfect. It's like a stylish hotel suite with all the benefits of feeling like a proper local. I will be booking again for future work trips.
17296930,504781986,2019-08-08,56208539,Sophie,We had a lovely experience at this stay. The host was very responsive and attentive anytime we needed anything. We were walking distance to so many cute restaurants and coffee shops. The apartment itself was great. The perfect size for two people. The open window / with a balcony railing was a wonderful touch. We’d stay here again. Thank you for having us.
17296930,512345083,2019-08-18,4745422,Anthony,"I’ve been in something like 10 Airbnbs so far and this was head and shoulders my best experience. It’s beautifully done inside, is super comfortable, and actually felt like a home. I have nothing bad to say other than I’m bummed that this flat is occupied so often (and I suspect that will be the case for well into the future)."
17296930,515808357,2019-08-23,39863917,Monica,"Perfect for business travel. Well located, clean and SUPER spacious. I'd happily stay again based on location alone. Though I will say getting a carry on and a full sized suitcase up multiple flights of stairs was tough. Once inside, the apartment was perfect."
17296930,525233005,2019-09-07,83863240,Christine,"Stylish cool industrial space. I enjoyed my stay overall. One thing is, if you are a light sleeper, please prepare some ear plugs. The wall seemed quite thin of the building, and you can hear people when they come back late and had a laughter in their room."
17296930,533292321,2019-09-21,48010592,Sam,"Excellent apartment in the perfect area of Shoreditch. Great coffee shop right next door and very close to supermarket and public transport plus loads of great restaurants, bars and shops. Branca was excellent with communication. There was loud noise late at night from neighbours a couple of times during our stay but Branca was able to help resolve this which was helpful. There is no washing machine in the apartment as advertised but Branca organised laundry to be done and delivered back to us."
17296930,536306763,2019-09-26,134271331,Gautam,"Phenomenonal location, very comfortable bed and every amenity you could need (save for a washing machine). Would definitely stay again."
17296930,543253106,2019-10-07,16887615,Brent,I had a very pleasant stay at Branca’s place. The flat was very clean and beautiful. It was within walking distance from all of the places I wanted to see in Shoreditch and very close to the station. Branca was very responsive to any requests I made. I would definitely stay here again!
17296930,546049128,2019-10-13,170545459,Anne,"Lovely apartment in Shoreditch, close to station. Lots of nice shops and restaurants in the area. The apartment is tastefully decorated and is  very clean and comfortable throughout. Located on quiet street so not a lot of noise and the bedroom at the rear of the property was very quiet. It is worth noting that there is no microwave but otherwise the kitchen is well equipped. Branca very kindly provided a coffee machine at our request. I would definitely stay here again."
17296930,550088847,2019-10-18,18166056,Camila,Adorei o apartamento da Branca! A decoração é contemporânea e confortável e tem tudo que se precisa quando se está em viagem.

17296930,565361253,2019-11-17,27560055,Lauren,"The location of this apartment cannot be beat. It’s right in the heart of Shoreditch, a stones throw away from great bars, restaurants, shops, and the brick lane market. The place itself was pretty spacious and comfortable, with check in and check out being especially easy. Branca was also quite accommodating and easy to communicate with. I’d definitely recommend staying here if you want to be in Shoreditch."

17296930,599893593,2020-01-31,3811566,Jose,"Spacious and beautifully decorated in minimalist style. Marble bathroom, felt like I was on vacation rather than a business trip. Super responsive host."

We stayed when it was pretty hot (for the UK) and fans were provided which was a dream. I will definitely be booking again! Thanks so much!"

17296930,500603085118277612,2021-11-21,49764527,Maria,Fantastic apartment in a great location.  Great space for a weekend in this area of London.  Bed was comfortable and is quiet at the back (although you may also want earplugs to avoid being woken up at 4am by people leaving nearby premises).  Branca was fantastic - communication was great and we were even able to leave our bags after checkout to visit a gallery.  We loved it and will be back.

17618552,138593793,2017-03-20,57610236,Marta,"I'd like to thank Lily for being such a nice hostess.  She was very flexible with our arrival times and gave some good tips for London. <br/><br/>If you wish, you can also cook in the kitchen. <br/><br/>The room was very big and you even have a closet for you. The one downsize was the bed which was not very confortable. The matress was very thin and too hard.<br/><br/>Metro station is not far from her place. <br/>"
17618552,140204555,2017-03-28,357874,Guy,"Great spot for sure. Quiet and peaceful yet a ten minute walk will get you to a tube station as well as quite a few buses, a cool indie movie theatre, a supermarket and countless pubs and places to eat without having the feeling that you are in a tourist trap.<br/>Very multi cultural neighborhood which to me, encapsulates London.<br/>London can be intimidating as far as walking distances but I found the location to be very central.<br/>Also, a little walk south bound and you're right by the river which is, weather allowing, a great walk toward The Tower etc.<br/><br/>Lily's place was super comfy, clean and as mentioned above, quiet, which really suited my purpose. Communication with Lily was a breeze prior arrival and during the stay.<br/><br/>For folks flying in to Gatwick, it's super handy as you grab the shuttle from the airport to Victoria and then one line will take directly to the closest station, Whitechapel.<br/><br/>So yeah, two thumbs way up!!l Highly recommended!!"
17618552,173325186,2017-07-23,357874,Guy,"Second stay there and what can I say that I haven't said before? Great communication, great location and great host!"

17618552,548357416,2019-10-17,56070152,Mala,"Lily is an attentive, accommodating, and quick responding host.  The day I arrived, she was supposed to come back late from work and couldn't be there for the 6 pm check in.  She understood my reasons for needing to check in at 6 and rearranged her work schedule to meet me--I so appreciated that!  She was very kind to spend some time with me providing directions, routes, underground, and bus schedules (I had never been to London before and was a bit overwhelmed with how to get around).  My visit to London was both recreational and professional so having a quiet space to do some work was great.  It was an easy 15 minute walk to the nearest underground station (Whitechapel).  Thanks again, Lily!"

17618552,592915528,2020-01-14,116169917,Alicia,Lily was extremely sweet and welcoming. The apartment had just what I needed for a one night stay: a clean space in a quiet neighborhood so I could get a good night's sleep.

Lily’s place was a simple great spot to rest my head. The area is safe and reliable. I walked around at night without a problem. Plenty of restaurants nearby too.

Lily is very friendly and helpful, she provided details of the local supermarkets etc. Note it is completely self catering. I have suggested that tea, coffee and milk in the kitchen would be a nice touch. It is about 10 mins walk from stations perhaps 5 minutes to buses towards the City. would recommend. Also the Two Magpies cafe on  nearby Commercial Rd is a great place for Breakfast."
17618552,414805267147553830,2021-07-26,411468968,Phoenix,"The bed is comfortable and cozy, I slept very well these days. Since this is my first time to live in London, Lily gave me useful information about the transportation, buying me some local food and even provided me a book about the tourist attractions in London. <br/>It is a satisfying 10-days stay."
17618552,422953500505648643,2021-08-06,217605731,Holly,"Had a good 2 week stay at Lily's place. She was lovely and helpful, easy to communicate with, and gave good advice on places to go. She also allowed me to reschedule after having to initially cancel due to self isolating. The place is clean and the room has lots of storage space and a desk which was handy. It was nice and quiet, I rarely came across anyone in the house, and had lots of privacy. <br/><br/>I was able to use the kitchen and a few utensils and had space to store food. I didn't use it to cook other than the microwave but I imagine I would have been able to if I'd asked. There was someone staying in the living room area for some of the time so I didn't feel I could really use this area but this didn't really bother me. It maybe made it feel slightly awkward to go in the kitchen late in the evening (e.g. to get a drink) as it was only separated by a curtain but I was never prevented from doing this so it wasn't really a problem.<br/><br/>Its in a handy location for central London with a few tube stations within a ten minute walk. Having a parking space was very helpful as well if you are driving in. Overall enjoyed my stay at Lily's place and felt it was good value for money for a short term stay in London."

17618552,481731407104685928,2021-10-26,3166689,Erica,Lily's room is exactly as described and great for a short visit to London. Lily is a lovely host and everything was exactly as described.
17618552,483795794163989549,2021-10-29,428374507,Tim,"Really nice landlady, good comms, very clean, very comfy bed and pillow, well placed for tubes (10 min stroll) and supermarkets (five-minute walk). All of it positive and would definitely stay again. The only downside was that the picture of the sitting room is a bit misleading as that part is actually being let out to someone else, but you still have use of the kitchen (fridge/microwave/cutlery/crockery/mug), bathroom and a very nice bedroom and part of the sitting room to eat at a table if you want."
17618552,495500849233821149,2021-11-14,339525205,Paul,Lily was extremely helpful in letting me know of good places and spots to enjoy my stay in London. She was very kind from beginning to end thank you lily!

17700664,700157653,2020-10-13,121542707,Christopher,"All and all the place was great, there were a few issues that were not major, but the host will always help you. The doors could not open at all, however it was raining most of the time. The oven needs a good clean, might have just been someone that used it, and spilt in it. The bathroom was slightly not what we were expecting, however it was OK. Some work needs to be done minor adjustments, however the host will hopefully rectify them for the future guests. Overall, lovely place."
18090524,144311611,2017-04-15,113868756,Paymon,We received a super warm welcome and we enjoyed a pleasant stay at Niels's place. The house itself is fully equipped with everything we needed for our nights stay and is in a great location.
18090524,146633996,2017-04-23,125121306,Jordan,"Lovely flat in a suburb of West London. Near White City and Ladbroke Grove stations, both within a 15 minute walk or a 4 minute Uber. Great access into Central London - Soho etc. All facilities spotless and the hosts were lovely. Gave us lots of local tips, were always accessable for any questions and let us store luggage till a late afternoon train home. Perfect hosts in a lovely flat! "

18090524,152263050,2017-05-15,5173909,Nathalie,Niels nous a chaleureusement accueillis. Il s'est adapté à notre arrivée et il est venu nous chercher au métro. Son appartement est adorable et il avait pensé à nous laisser des petites choses à manger pour notre accueil. Il était disponible pour toutes nos questions durant le séjour. Merci infiniment à lui et à son amie tout aussi accueillante que lui ! 
18090524,155488676,2017-05-28,42588466,Hui,"Niels and Camille are very kind people, helping us late check-in around 10 pm and keep the left belongings for me even after check-out. This house is located in a very safe, quiet and beautiful community with easy access to the center. Really recommend walking around. Thanks for giving us such a trustable and exciting experience in the first time on Airbnb. Cheers and Good luck to you. "

18090524,162038832,2017-06-19,57638621,S,"Apartment was bright and spacious and accessible by walking distance to multiple to be stations as well as close by bus stops. Westfield shopping centre quite close and a Tesco right around the corner came in very handy. Good Wi-Fi strength. I loved the bedroom mattress. Owner was very prompt, courteous and informative in all our communications. I would definitely recommend this place. "
18090524,162813508,2017-06-22,17696270,Yie,This place is great for its location whereby it's close to transportations and quiet for a good night sleep. The hosts are very welcoming and always ready to assist. Great job! 
18090524,164430129,2017-06-27,4847469,Justin,Neils place was a great spot to stay in London.  Very close to the bus line and a 15 min walk to the tube to go explore London.   The flat itself had everything you need and a very comfortable bed and couch. Neils walked us through everything and very easy to communicate with.  I would recommend his place to others and would be happy to stay there again.   
18090524,165916802,2017-07-02,24171431,Song Chin,"Niels is a super host, though we didn't get to meet him when checked in but his friend Raphael was they to meet us and his was very helpful and friendly, gave us tips to get around ( citymapper is such a useful app) . <br/>Niels texted us every day just to make sure everything is fine and gave us good suggestions to restaurant and places to go.  He suggested us to go Kensington Gardens (which was just so relax and fun for the whole  family, we went there for a picnic.) and also a good Chinese restaurant for Dim Sum near there.  We had such a great time staying at Niels apartment, it's very clean and spacious.  Thank you Niels, Camille and Raphael!!"
18090524,168348678,2017-07-09,66857784,Mary,"The apartment is wonderfull, separate rooms and new bathroom! really nice and quiet district! the underground station is not very far! Niels is really hospitable and helpfull! Gave as very detailed instructions! so we were happy to live there! thank you very much! "
18090524,171714242,2017-07-18,131398604,April,"Niels home was very clean and in a really nice neighborhood. Close to a great pub and a market to pick up food. The only downsides would be that I would say the second bed is really uncomfortable, a pull out couch, okay if your only staying a few days. Also the commute into the heart of the city really needs to be considered when you book this flat. At least 45 min to a hour each way. I wouldn't recommend if you are traveling with kids. But perfect for a couple "
18090524,182705713,2017-08-15,101121680,Mengyue,"Niels is very nice person, he gives us many suggestions for the trip and keep s in touch with us. It is a lovely house with convenient transport and cozy environment. We have wonderful experience during these days!"
18090524,197432873,2017-09-25,6597189,Miriam,"Camille and Niels were very kind hosts answering questions promptly and upon our somewhat early arrival easy going for leaving our luggage. The appartment is light, comfortably furnished, very quiet and situated at a nice square. We definitely recommend this place and will stay here again upon our next visit to London. London centre is easy to reach by public transport, but we also liked neighbourhood and the nearby Portobello road."
18090524,199058347,2017-10-01,21796133,Marie,"We stayed for two nights, the hosts were very friendly and had some great tips about what to do nearby. The place is beautiful and in a central location, would absolutely go again! Thank you!"

The flat is lovely: lots of light and a wonderful bed. We received a very warm welcome, a flat to remember!"

18090524,282783110,2018-06-28,367163,William,"A comfortable flat in residential North Kensington, about a 15 minute walk from the Latimer Road underground station. It took about 30-40 minutes on Tube to access most tourist sites (eg Tower of London) About 20 minute walk to shopping/eating Notting Hill and Portabello Road.  There was Tesco express just around the corner, and St Helen's Bakery about a 6 minute walk.  Some traffic noise at front of flat (bus roundabout).  It is a second floor flat, two or three flights of stairs. Very nice shower/tub, great water pressure and hot water. Pull out sofa only for one person. Good wifi.  No television. Host Niels provided very prompt responses."
18090524,284375297,2018-07-01,81633980,Jim,Really enjoyed our stay Niel was a super host. Very helpful indeed! Definitely recommend a visit.

18090524,300858457,2018-08-03,28393087,Annie,Niels and Camille are really charming hosts. The apartment is very well located near a metro station and grocery store. The place is charming and quiet.

18090524,306027620,2018-08-12,33440482,Evelyn,"A very homely space in a quiet and nice area of London, near Portobello Road Market and the amazing Westfield London - the giant mall where locals get their shopping done - It made Oxford street shopping pale in comparison haha. The hosts were a lovely couple and they gave us a very warm welcome which was much appreciated after a 15 hour flight from Asia. Amazing hospitality, and very prompt responses. Also there was a Tesco supermarket just round the corner, very convenient. Remember to ask Camille for the great Thai place if you need some comfort food - who doesn’t love Thai? Thanks for everything Niels and Camille :)"
18090524,309636274,2018-08-18,72745649,Paola,"L’appartamento di Neils è molto carino, in posizione comoda (zona 2 della metropolitana con fermata dell’autobus a due passi da casa) per raggiungere il centro. Gli spazi sono confortevoli, c’è un bel bagno nuovo con vasca e doccia e ci si sta comodi anche in 4 grazie al divano letto in soggiorno. L’unica pecca, dal nostro punto di vista di ospiti italiani è la pulizia. Secondo noi si potrebbe fare di più. Nel complesso è stato comunque un piacevole soggiorno e Niels e la sua fidanzata sono stati molto gentili e accoglienti. "
18090524,315663457,2018-08-29,11467680,Sarah,Niels and Camille are super friendly and attentive. There appartment is exactly as in the pictures. a 10 min walk from ladbroke groove and portibello market. we loved staying here :)<br/><br/>

It was located a 10-15 min walk away from the nearest underground station, and the neighborhood was very cute and safe. There was a grocery store just around the corner, and Notting Hill was also just a 15 min walk away. Niels and Camille gave us great food and sightseeing recommendations and even helped us figure out the heater one night when we had trouble. Their flat was clean and charming. Hands down the best experience I’ve ever had with AirBnb. I can’t recommend them enough!"
18090524,364214722,2018-12-30,142788672,Azril,"Niels is truly a superhost. <br/><br/>The location is quiet and not touristy so this topic is up to your liking. The only cons is that you need to climb two floors up. But again, this is London!"

18186852,182255622,2017-08-14,120459132,Philip,"We were 3 adults and 2 kids. The place was perfect for us spending 4 nights. Anna gave us more bath towel. We didn't feel any uneasiness. During my travel in Cornwall, Hiten let me leave two piece of luggage for 3 days even already checked out few days ago. The location is wonderful near Gloucester Road Station with three important line, Circle, District $ Piccadilly. Even though room for 5 person is located on basement, it has sufficient skylights and does not abut onto the road for main entrance, we feel assured privacy. <br/>Highly recommended for family trip."

There's mould and bad-condition paint on some of the walls due to humidity (both on the living room and the bathroom).<br/><br/>Host provided details for one main Wifi network plus 3 backups. Main network didn't work and none of the backup networks existed.<br/><br/>Apartment cleaning was below ""just-ok"", but not entering the ""disgusting"" area. Linens and towels looked and felt clean, though."
18186852,185249810,2017-08-21,4036339,Christopher,This place is in a great location in London.  Our family of five enjoyed this spot a bunch.  Having a washing machine for our clothes helped a ton.  The only negative about the whole thing was there is a water leakage issue and water damage on the walls.  The flat seemed damp the whole time we were there .  But overall great stay and we would go back for sure.
18186852,188054231,2017-08-28,127060680,Lisa,"Great Location, you are in a quiet place and in the middle of the City under 20 mins!

18186852,196420931,2017-09-23,130640642,Christina,Sadly our reservation was cancelled 2 1/2 hours before our check in. We were on our way travelling to flat. Hiten was apologetic and kind. <br/>But the air bnb procedure to find another flat seemed inadequate especially as we were travelling. It wasnt very clear who was to book the next flat for us at last minute. in the end we did scurry around calling and asking for a quick reservation and room.
18186852,200459472,2017-10-05,105499102,Gerardo,"Es un estudio muy cómodo y funcional, muy bien equipado, muy limpio. Hiten nos estaba esperando cuando llegamos.

18186852,218387693,2017-12-12,1948566,Steffie Marshalina,Hiten’s apt was very cozy and spacious for a studio. Also very close to public transport and the museum.

18186852,326099862,2018-09-21,68954707,Kenneth,"The place is located in a upscale, safe and easily accessible neighbourhood. with the circle and Piccadilly line just a stone throw away, you can easily get to all the major areas in london with ease.<br/><br/>check in was a breeze and hiten and his team were very quick to respond to any questions throughout the stay and before that as well. <br/><br/>the unit was in a basement with no windows and no AC. this could be an issue in the summer. for me, it was quite stuffy. but hiten quickly responded my request and provided additional fans. i understand that it is common in the UK for homes to not have AC during the autumn and winter, but where i am from, we always have AC. but nonetheless, it was an issue easily resolved. <br/><br/>i would recommend you to stay here for the ease of access and overall good place to stay at."

The apartment was clean and clean towels and sheets were provided for everyone.<br/>Its location is unbeatable and it comes at a very fair price.<br/>Hiten was responding very quickly to any question we had and was also very kind to accommodate a special request we had. Will definitely choose to stay again!
18186852,422009775,2019-03-10,62613316,Thea,The apartment is in a prime location. I am from that part of London and was coming to take a friend out for a birthday weekend. Great access to all of London by tube and bus links. The flat was very clean and the lady who does the check in (Anna) could not have been more helpful. Would stay again!

18186852,430268123,2019-03-30,4908094,Justine,"Logement idéal : fonctionnel, propre, plaisant et très bien situé. Le métro est à quelques pas (Gloucester Road) qui permet de visiter Londres agréablement. <br/>Malgré le fait qu’il soit situé au sous sol il reste lumineux de part son aménagement. <br/>Vous trouverez une supérette du côté de la station de métro ou un M&S Food à Earl’s Court. <br/>Le quartier est silencieux, propre et agréable. <br/><br/>Seul bémol de ce séjour dont Hiten n’est pas responsable : le bruit des locataires du dessus tard dans la nuit"
18186852,432929206,2019-04-05,116532986,Libby,"The flat is exactly as the pictures and descriptions are posted. It was very spacious, especially for a studio. It was nice to have a washer. The only complaint is the people upstairs on our last night/morning were very loud, with kids running around. The location is great; two Underground stations and museums are a few blocks away. Hyde Park/Kensington Palace are about a 15 minute walk. I would stay here again."

18186852,467311390,2019-06-10,34553152,Stephen,"Hitens place was a find, great facility in a superb location (for Gloucester Road Tube, National History Museum and big Sainsburys). Hiten was a great and quick communicator.  Thank you"

18186852,501265058,2019-08-03,53779723,Chris,Clean and comfortable and a wonderful location. Perfect for a couple of days exploring London. We are a family of five and it was more than big enough for 3 nights of comfort
18186852,503055470,2019-08-05,5285028,Carmelita,It was an ok place for the price we paid.  Location is the strong point of this listing. <br/>Hiten was slightly slow in responding but the lady in charge of the apartment was very helpful.
18186852,521090738,2019-08-31,18308006,Lyly,"Appartement was close to the underground, the store room and toilette/shower available on arrival and departure is great. Appartement was nice and would definitely come back next time"

18186852,602974962,2020-02-08,304838829,Anna,"Minusy:<br/>- w całym mieszkaniu zapach stęchlizny, wielki grzyb w łazience (nawet w szafkach kuchennych czuć było grzyb), brak okien tylko prześwity, ogólnie ciemny i ponury pokój, brak lampy stojącej (niezgodnie ze zdjęciem)<br/>+ lokalizacja, wygodne łóżka, wyposażenie (żelazko, deska do prasowania, kuchenka mikrofalowa), blisko sklepy, KFC, Sturbucks, Tesco; ogólnie bezpieczna dzielnica"
18186852,606284530,2020-02-16,168591805,Glen William,"Hiten was extremely helpful and responsive. His apartment was sparkling clean, pleasant and comfortable. We were a total of 5 guests in the apartment and had ample space to move around, sort and store our luggages. Since we had an early check-out and our flight was in the evening, Hiten kindly offered a safe space for us in the building to store our luggages whilst we go around London during our last day. Would definitely recommend and visit again in the future!"

18186852,652671111,2020-08-17,179910702,Joseph Daniel,"Moldy basement apartment, no AC and a puny fan that didn't help, and a single room for everything. It was fine for two days, but only because the London summer wasn't too hot on those days. The musty smell was rough though."
18186852,659035364,2020-08-31,293172683,Sarah,"Communication from Hiten was outstanding - very helpful, with instant replies to messages. The apartment was clean and pretty spacious with comfortable beds. The location was brilliant - 5 mins to Gloucester Rd tube and supermarkets. The only downside - no reflection on the owner - was the inconsiderate noise from the occupants above. Loud music and screaming at all hours, which was a shame as it was the only black mark on our stay in London."
18186852,667422178,2020-09-24,41991843,Vicky,Great location and great host! A little bit issue with the internet but Hiten was quick to response. Would love to stay again.

A cama e o sofá cama são muito confortáveis.<br/>O que deixou a desejar foi o quesito limpeza. O box do chuveiro estava sujo e ralo bem entupido. No quarto havia poeira próxima às portas e na cozinha os utensílios também estavam sujos. Sentimos falta, também, de panos de prato para secarmos a louça lavada.<br/>O contato com o anfitrião foi excelente, sempre prestativo com informações do local, da retirada das chaves e até nos ofereceu, caso fosse preciso, um local para guardarmos as malas após o check-out."

18224323,206453253,2017-10-25,31124897,Helen,"Great location, easy to find and looked great on first view.. Unusually though for an Airbnb the kitchen had very little in it - no tea, coffee, sugar or condiments.   Also only one bowl, cooking utensils were missing and no tea towels to dry dishes. Had a washing machine but no instructions. Shower head did not work and there was no plug, or grate in basin.<br/>Bed was comfortable but was too big for the room making it difficult to get into the far side. It also prevented the wardrobe doors from fully opening. No bedside lamp.<br/>This place could've been fabulous, however, the missing detail let it down."
18224323,208616067,2017-11-02,12078665,Eric,Small repairs were done immediately - and everything was all right!

Zona de comedor con sofa-cama grande y una habitacion con cama doble. El lavabo un poco pequeño pero suficiente. La ubicacion es lo mejor al lado. Esta en una calle tranquila, pero a dos calle del metro y zona de restaurantes, supermercado barato, tiendas... Nosotros nos movimos en Bici i tambiem hay dos paratas de Santander bike al lado. <br/>Ali ha sido muy atento, llegamos pronto para entrar al apartamento pero pudimos dejar en su oficina las maletas y pasar a buscarlas mas tarde ya para poder entrar."

It's located a short walk from Kensington Gardens, arriving at the entrance where they have the Diana Memorial Playground (perfect for preschoolers) and then we walked across the park to get to Natural History Museum and also the Science Museum. The flat was on the 4th floor but has a lift which was great with the pushchair.  It's a very basic flat, but clean and comfortable and I would definitely choose to stay here again. The only downside was some noise from the upstairs flat."

The apartment has everything you need for a short stay - bath towels, cutlery, hair dryer - and the washing machine! Wifi works well. Close to Hyde Park,  5 min walk from Bayswater tube station and 15 min from Paddington. There are plenty of shops near eg Sainsbury's, Tesco, Waitrose etc so had no trouble with cooking. Very good value for money, especially for the central location. Communication was very quick and the check in really easy."

18224323,473341181,2019-06-21,28645324,Rav,"Great place - super central, right where you want to be."
18224323,481279951,2019-07-04,3608186,Suveen,"Good place with basic amenities, great location. Ali was quite responsive."
18224323,531713996,2019-09-18,36335000,Antonio,"O apartamento é otimo, melhor do que aparenta nas fotos. Muito bem localizado a 3 quadras do hide park e a duas do metro. Diversos supermercados e restaurantes por perto.  O Ali foi ótimo, respondendo rápido e passando informações claras e objetivas sobre o apartamento, localização, check in e out excelentes. Recomendo muito."
18224323,491162481118653183,2021-11-08,5027033,Gregory,This was a great spot. It was very big and spacious and I will definitely be going back!
18387801,151592949,2017-05-13,2531094,Ahsan,"I had a terrific stay at Elliot's place. The room is huge and has its own private bathroom, which is hard to find in London. He and his flat mates are really laid back guys and the area is also great. Would definitely recommend. "
18678502,153583806,2017-05-21,31448903,Kiran,"Newly refurbished and very clean. The location is quite well placed, easy to get to central London within 20-30 mins on the Jubilee line. Tube station and bus stops are very close. Just as in the pictures, the flat is a small studio but good value for money. The host was responsive and attended to issues straight away. Recommended!"
18678502,228532385,2018-01-20,32508645,Shante,"Great stay at a great place! I would definitely stay here again! Nice, cozy and quiet. I felt at home ."
18678502,330844109,2018-10-01,24088341,Toni,"I really loved the location. Friday and Saturday nights the tube runs all night and this line is perfect for getting back and forth. Adon was very helpful and accommodating when my flight was late. It is clean and the size is perfect for one, maximum 2 people. It has everything you need; microwave, refrigerator, stove, cups, plates. The only thing missing were utensils. Everything was perfect and I will book again. Also, if you attend the beauty show Nailympia, it is only a few stops away ."
18678502,501980034924815777,2021-11-23,393809,Jason,"The place is right beside some good food options, and tube station. Water pressure is good, hot shower.  The building seems like it's mostly for long term rentals. Strange encounter with another tenant when I was trying to get the key from the lockbox - was uncomfortable when they kept asking why we were here. During the last day of my stay, received an unexpected knock on the door when someone asked to show the unit. Luckily we were home at the time - they seemed surprised that the unit was occupied. Some advance warning here would have been nice. The place is smaller than expected based on the pictures (a few of the pictures are not even the same unit), it barely fits two people + 4 carry on sized luggage. The internet is good when it works, 54 mbps down and 11.6 mbps up. However, it didn't work at all for the last 2 days when I had important calls to take care of, the host was initially responsive (when we needed towels the first day), but stopped responding following up on the internet. Overall, good value for the money, no showstopping issues, just some interesting experiences, wouldn't recommend if you have other options."
18725903,162830291,2017-06-22,123906280,Grzegorz,"It was a very pleasant stay! I really loved the quiet and peacefulness of both - the neighborhood and the room I stayed in for a four days. <br/>Two nearby parks are an awesome place to stay with a blanket and make a picnic or just to rest in a shade of old, beautiful trees in one park or in sun in another. <br/>Tube is close enough and going to Central London is fast. <br/>The room was clean and nice with new furnitures and very comfortable bed and pillows :-)<br/>Nice bathroom with a bath and a shower. <br/>Maria was very friendly and communicative, we had a few nice chats. I wish I spent more time at place to chat more with her and her boyfriend. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend that place!  "
18725903,163711216,2017-06-25,14157064,Shaun,"Maria's home is in a very quiet area in south London. The bed was very comfortable and Maria herself is super nice. I was in London for a course and after the first day Maria and I had a great chat where she asked all about what I do, what I'd been learning, and I was actually able to help her with a course she was doing too.<br/>Overall a great place, bed, and host. Highly recommended."
18725903,166043365,2017-07-02,29792977,Benjamin,"Excellent location in south London, quite residential area, 10 mins walk from the tube station. Would stay at Maria's apartment again."
18725903,166700436,2017-07-04,75234455,Marco,"<br/>My stay was very enjoyable. Maria was very welcoming and helped me for any need. The room is not very spacious but I think it is ideal for those looking for only a place to sleep. Is very close to the metro, and to the wimbledon club where I spent a wonderful day. Very recommended apartment!"
18725903,168474726,2017-07-09,21781007,Alessandro,Veryeasy to access the house from the tube and Maria is so nice ! The house is super clean as well !
18725903,173520737,2017-07-23,70663659,Caleb,The flat located in a quiet neighborhood 10 minutes away from the Collier's Wood station and bus stops to nearby towns. It is also 10 minutes away from an M&S and Sainsbury's. Maria is really easy to get along with and accommodating. Her flat is super clean and comfortable.
18725903,175650941,2017-07-29,20218627,Béla,Everything was perfect.
18725903,177669839,2017-08-03,31643730,Tim And Christy,"Communication and check in was fine :) The room was clean and bed was really comfy, the desk was handy to work from, we liked the big window for air too. We had a little trouble with the lock getting in but after a good few minutes were able to turn and wriggle until it unlocked. Its about a 10 min walk to Colliers Wood station which era you to London Bridge in 20 mins and 15 mins away there is a shopping centre with two huge supermarkets and clothes stores!"
18773665,154375622,2017-05-24,71062446,Paulina,Really cozy and private room. Just 5 minutes walking distance to underground station and it has bus 24/7. Sophie is a careful person and will answers a your questions in order to make your stay comfortable 
18773665,158759601,2017-06-08,34120458,Murielle,"Sophie's flat is very nice and convenient, near several public transports for central London. Camden market is 5mn by foot, and opens every day. The room is nice and the bed comfy, 3 other housemates leave upstairs but you are indépendant. I didn't meet Sophie but we had a very good communication before and during the stay, for any issues. Thank you for everything "
18773665,160736976,2017-06-15,131179530,Emiliano,"Muy buena ubicación, el bus en la puerta de casa y toda la magia del camden"
18773665,167354335,2017-07-06,131177781,Mike And Esther,"We are a couple that stayed 3 nights. The room is comfortable and bright, and by the main bathroom and living room in the flat. There are 3 other roommates living in the flat, so you will see them coming and going, cooking, etc. Very pleasant and helpful. The neighborhood is fun, but can be noisy. However, from my experience most of London seemed noisy. I recommend earplugs if you are not used to street noise. We slept much better with them in."
18782767,160249632,2017-06-13,4176937,Francis,"Awesome place (and I've stayed at many!) - new building, good view from room, felt very private, walkable to Caledonian Road which is one stop from Kings X (most connected  train station in London). "
18782767,164225924,2017-06-26,46514343,Mike,I had a great time at Ahmed's!
18782767,164235248,2017-06-26,29467824,Sofia,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
18782767,165564746,2017-07-01,91433795,Minh,A lovely place for a busy day in London.
18782767,168285134,2017-07-09,7577399,Shane,It's a good place close to central London. It's about 20 minutes walk to King's Cross. Ahmed is a friendly guy.
18782767,193426657,2017-09-13,137445418,Weitao,I like Armed's coffee and the machine.

18782767,194616788,2017-09-17,7577399,Shane,I stayed here two times and if I need to start in London I will try to stay here again.. it's close to King's Cross station and it has a shop beside it. It's quiet at night time but close to public transport.<br/><br/>Ahmed is a friendly guy and actually the other guests were very friendly too.
18782767,197323396,2017-09-25,32482771,Tonia,"Ahmed is a really nice guy and his place is lovely,  clean,  modern and comfortable.  It's very near a bus stop and tube station making it easy to get around.  I appreciate staying with him and definitely recommend staying here."
18782767,201343713,2017-10-08,11977639,Leah,"A great find! Ahmed is a wonderful host and his room is very comfortable. Great location, within 10mins walk of Caledonian Road tube station (Piccadily line) and walkable to both King's Cross and Camden Town. Has a shop in the building and, despite being relatively central, it's a very peaceful place. Highly recommend. Will be staying again next time I visit London."
18782767,212332449,2017-11-17,5361911,Yuichi,Ahmed was a wonderful and mind host. He was very easygoing and was attentive as well. I hope to stay again in the near future.
18782767,214247871,2017-11-25,159708910,İhsan,Ahmed is a polite gentleman. He offered me coffee and baklava as soon as I arrived home.

18969636,178864990,2017-08-06,103333911,Rasel,"Ruchira was a great host, she made us feel very welcome, her house has recently been renovated, loved the kitchen and shower which has been done to a very high standard, room was very spacious, would highly recommend to others"
18969636,186339445,2017-08-24,134777718,Julie,Ruchira and her family are lovely people who will make you feel like one of the family. The home is close to Heathrow with public transportation directly across the street. The room is in the central part of the home and has its own private bath with shower. You will enjoy your stay with this kind family.
18969636,188969509,2017-08-31,73496266,Naveen,Very friendly clean place.
18969636,191176339,2017-09-06,148520746,Mohammed,This was a very pleasant stay with a lovely family. So kind and helpful in every way. The room was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was very clean; it was all brand new. Would definitely visit again!
18969636,195412726,2017-09-19,67109884,Xiaoning,"a very pleasant stay, had a good time over there"
18969636,198429951,2017-09-29,138481685,David,I really enjoyed my stay at Kapila and Ruchiras home. They are a kind and considerate family who let me have all the privacy I needed at the same time as being friendly and helpful. The room and home are very clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend staying with them.
18969636,198654544,2017-09-30,26749792,Goodlow,We had a wonderful short stay with this fantastic host. Quick response to a last minute booking due to flight delays. The room was beautifully decorated and comfortable with all my needs. I was offered food and beverages with a very clean bathroom. I'm highly pleased with our stay and recommend this location for those who need to be close to the airport. The local food was great and within 10-15 mins walking distance. Wifi worked well for business and the bed was comfortable. Even allowed us to leave our bags for just a few hours for lunch. Awesome host!!
18969636,199854277,2017-10-03,101590942,Mohan,Had a great stay.
18969636,200753082,2017-10-06,152508599,Simone,It was not so noisy in spite of near the airport.<br/>They are kind and hospitality.<br/>It was not good access there by public transportation.
18969636,202431410,2017-10-11,129341060,Cean,Wonderful place to stay. See my other review! You can be sure that this is a top notch home.
18969636,206007188,2017-10-23,66925716,Calvin,"Great value, not too far from twickenham stadium either if you’re looking for a place for an event!"
18969636,208836364,2017-11-03,155924674,Kate,"A great place to stay, with a good host who looked after me, gave good advice and support and was very hospitable.  I felt very welcome and comfortable."
18969636,218198778,2017-12-11,21033087,Tracy,"I cannot rate Ruchira highly enough. She was exceptionally kind to my brother who was stranded overnight in Heathrow airport due to heavy snow. She and her husband welcomed him into their home and offered such genuine and outstanding hospitality. She embodies the ethos of Airbnb, meeting amazing people who open their homes for more than just a place to stay."
18969636,219033914,2017-12-16,108894217,Fei,"A Nice and warm host family, pleasant to be there. To the Heathrow airport, if you have local Oster card then you can take a bus which is few minutes away from the house, if not then it will be a little more than 10 minutes walk (ca 1.8km) to the Tube station. It's ideal for short stay at London and experience the local life."
18969636,223410567,2018-01-01,86344395,Bismah,Fantastic place. Very homely and welcoming. Nice spacious bedroom and a modern bathroom. We made ourselves at home from the moment we walked in. Nearest tube station is a short bus ride away with the bus stop directly outside the house. Will definitely stay here again.
18969636,226773538,2018-01-12,160552471,Tom,"One to avoid.<br/><br/>Very thinly walled room on ground floor between living room and kitchen. Hosts make a lot of noise until around 11:30pm every night, not a care in the world for their guests. No real sense of privacy either.<br/><br/>No on site parking, despite their claims. Really dirty kitchen. Rude hosts. Only place I've ever stayed where the host enters room and moved around my stuff.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else. It's in a grim area of London to boot. Absolutely no half decent eating places within 30 minutes walk.<br/><br/>There's really little good to be said for this place. Avoid."
18969636,228141362,2018-01-18,41349720,Tess,"I stayed here during the week for work and Ruchira and her family were really welcoming. It was great to stay at a home from home and I had everything I needed. Comfy bed, clean room and bathroom, excellent shower and Ruchira also kindly let me use the kitchen so I could prepare some light meals. A great stay and I would come back and stay again."
18969636,232209895,2018-02-04,53131621,Anjali,"We( my husband,lil one year old baby and I) stayed at Ruchira and Kapila's place for more than a week and it was an absolute pleasure. We felt very comfortable and relaxed throughout our stay. Ruchira explained about all amenities properly and told us about the available transport as well as food options around the place.<br/>Traveling with a small baby, my biggest worry was the food preparation. Even before we arrived, Ruchira had contacted me to check what all I would need as I planned to cook small meals for my baby. Although Ruchira had mentioned that just basic cooking could be done in the kitchen, she provided me with all the necessary items required. As a matter of fact,the kitchen is very well equipped and maintained in a highly clean and orderly manner. They are a very warm couple and helped us a lot with their suggestions. Our jet -lagged baby was very unsettled during the initial days and would wake up in the middle of the night and start playing around making a lot of noise. They understood our situation and not even once did they complain about any disturbance. They have a bubbly daughter who played along with our son and made his stay enjoyable too!:-) This was our first stay via Airbnb and we are happy that we met such amazing hosts who not just opened their home but also their arms and welcomed us happily.<br/>Will definitely visit this place again!"
18969636,233179432,2018-02-08,41349720,Tess,"Another fantastic stay while I work away on business. Warm and friendly family with great amenities, space and comfort. Will stay again!"
18969636,239126832,2018-02-28,41075134,Vishal,Nice place and a friendly family. Thanks for the hospitality.
18969636,243267556,2018-03-15,11184158,Nick,"Lovely room, comfy bed. Bathroom (across the hallway) very clean, excellent shower. The bedroom is right in the heart of this family home, between kitchen and living room but it still felt private, and the family were very quiet and discreet."
18969636,245440282,2018-03-22,17818025,Matthew,I stayed in this lovely double room which was warm and comfortable. Across the hallway is the bathroom which is very modern. I enjoyed a lovely few night's sleep.

Comfortable bed, and the nicely fitted bathroom is just a few steps along the hallway.  The shower is excellent.  Ruchira and her family are very friendly and make you feel welcome."
18969636,257766991,2018-04-27,15880343,Praveena,"Our stayed at Ruchira's house was just for one day. The stay was good and Ruchira is a wonderful host. She even shared her Oyster card to us so that we can travel to London. Thanks, Ruchira."

Ruchira and family are very warm and welcoming.  House is close to Heathrow (Uber - 20 minutes) and Hounslow Tube stops (Uber 5-7 minutes).   Very modern bathroom and kitchen as well.  Excellent stay.
18969636,330246777,2018-09-30,216681366,Rahul,Very nice offering. Our week's stay was perfect. Very nice room and it was always super clean. <br/>We absolutely loved our host and her help offered to us. The complete family is very nice and doesn't disturb you ever. Ruchira is a kind lady and gave us all the help we needed.
18969636,334048213,2018-10-08,205242572,Huda,Ruchira is the perfect host. The room and the bathroom were nice. The room was a little bit cold but other than that everything was fine.
18969636,340214995,2018-10-23,16558755,Suthan,. Bedroom has only french window opening into kitchen. You can either have natural light or privacy not both at the same time. Good value for money though.

18969636,474572742,2019-06-23,235609007,Mark,"Ruchira, is a lovely host. Great communication, quick response & very helpful. Room was great. I'd definitely stay there again!"
18969636,478778685,2019-06-30,40254960,Mandy,"This is a clean, tidy ground floor bedroom with a private shower room - which is small, and across a corridor into the kitchen, but it’s clean and has an excellent power shower. I was aware of people moving around in the kitchen in the morning, but it wasn’t intrusive in any way. The bed was a little firm for me but that’s very much down to personal preference.<br/>Ruchira was lovely to deal with - prompt with responses and helpful when we wanted an early self check in. <br/>It’s about a 25 minute walk to the nearest tube station, which puts you on the Piccadilly Line straight into town. <br/>You certainly couldn’t ask for better value for money so close to London."
18969636,479776542,2019-07-01,129898319,Nargis,"It was everything that I had expected, a spacious room and comfortable bed all nice and clean. I had a peaceful stay here and would probably visit again! Thanks for having me."

18969636,488587450,2019-07-15,143441333,Neha,Had a comfortable stay at Ruchira's place. She is a warm host and her house is lovely with all necessary amenities. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for PLAB2 exam coaching accommodation here. The house is a little far from the train station but the bus stop is right outside the house with good connection till the station. Would definitely go back if I happen to visit again. :)

We never missed our home on the ten days stay there. She still calls frequently and she's like a well wisher for us. The whole place was really beautiful, well cleaned and maintained. There was proper heating facility, WiFi and much more. She even taught me to cook some traditional dishes also. There are lot of grocery shops and restaurants near the place. The other guests as well as the hosts were like a family together there. We had a good rapport with them."

18983109,159984111,2017-06-12,50885150,Riccardo,"Bellissimo appartamento, proprio come le foto. <br/>Bisogna fare due rampe di scale perché l'appartamento è al piano di sopra, però molto pulito. Perfetto per il soggiorno di una settimana o due, perché il frigo è quello classico piccolino quindi non ci sta molta roba. <br/>A 10 minuti a piedi ci sono due parchi piccolini e due fermate del treno, una a est e una a ovest. <br/>Consiglio di utilizzare le bici e muoversi con quelle alle varie fermate. <br/>Per il resto ci siamo trovati molto bene, la comunicazione con chi ci ha ospitato è stata perfetta, idem il trattamento che abbiamo ricevuto. <br/>4 stelle e mezzo! <br/>Consigliatissimo <br/>"
18983109,163353511,2017-06-24,121199416,Rea,Great little place in the perfect location for us. Had all the normal mod cons and was just as clean as you'd expect from any good hotel. Kate was a great host and provided all the information you could possibly want for your stay. Would 100% recommend!
18983109,164232545,2017-06-26,12563714,Vicky,"Great, super clean, smart and comfortable flat in a good location for transport and access to central London and other areas.

18983109,167282438,2017-07-06,89063669,Caroline,"Host demanded money for alleged damages, we extended our stay to discuss this but she was unavailable. The issue has since been referred to Airbnb for intervention.  Traumatic experience"
18983109,168797592,2017-07-10,44965,Lee,"Easy check in with the lock box. It's a modern, clean and tidy apartment with all you really need. Great communication although didn't need to contact Kate whilst staying there. A short walk to Wandsworth town station, slightly longer to the main Clapham Junction station. Plenty restaurants within walking distance. Quiet neighbour (except for the odd arguing neighbour!). Very cosy for 4 people (2 adults, 2 kids) but perfect for a couple."
18983109,170814930,2017-07-16,122191701,Claire,"Lovely, clean, comfortable home. Really helpful host. We were very happy here and would definitely stay again."

19100249,590351372,2020-01-08,17948399,Michael,"We (my wife and I and 3 kids aged 12, 9 and 3) stayed at Fran's place for 1 month over Christmas and New Years 2019-2020. We very much enjoyed the apartment, the area, and Fran was on hand to answer any questions and help us get a second key etc. I would unreservedly recommend his place but note 3 issues. First, some mould developed on the walls in the adult bedroom. We then aired out the room and cleaned some of it off but could not remove it all. Second, occassionally there was noise elsewhere in the apartment complex at very late night hours. We turned off the buzzer to the apartment at night, and some of it may have resulted from Christmas/New Years festivities. Finally, and most trivially, the bed was not king as flagged but queen or smaller. These 3 issues did not detract from a great stay. We'd be happy to stay again and would recommend Fran's place to others. Ideal for a family holiday to London. Fran was a very responsive and helpful host."
19155975,183414546,2017-08-17,132301702,Victor,"Great place with a great host! The room is large and has it's own private bathroom.

Great for work/internships etc."
19155975,188083056,2017-08-28,9221455,Heidi,"Good, comfortable and quiet place to stay. Andrey is a very welcoming host. We had activities planned in Limehouse, so it was the best location ever for us. Plenty of public transport connections at a close distance. Would book it again for sure."
19155975,195934521,2017-09-21,142948854,Nicasio,"Andrey is a very friendly and helpful host and the apartment is very well located very close to Canary Wharf and two different DLR stations.<br/>The room is very spacious and the own bathroom is very convenient to have.<br/>Cleaning could be improved but not serious issues, and if you are not extremely sensitive to noise you should be OK, but bear in mind the room is located at street level (in a dead end, though)  and next to the main building lift.<br/>Smoking is allowed (in the garden)."

19155975,210238360,2017-11-08,17250591,Kate,"Andrey was very kind and helpful. Check-in/check-out was easy. The room and bathroom were fine for my weeklong stay. Nothing special, but for the price it was fine and I didn't spend much time there. It was an easy 5-7 minute walk to the DLR to connect into the Tube and I always felt safe walking it alone, day or night. There is definitely train and car noise, though I slept fine with my earplugs. I nearly always kept to my room, but I was grateful to be able to use the laundry machine in the kitchen during my stay."

Andrey was an amazing host, and was always more than helpful to help us with every small question that we had. He allowed us to use his kitchen, washing machine and was very generous! Thank you once again!"

Room with separate bathroom is great, double bed with one large blanket says 'nice for couples'. We were three, but it was fine as Andrey put a large airbed in the living room for us."

19155975,263235319,2018-05-11,20106520,Stephen,Andreys place is very convenient for the limehouse DLR. the flat is comfortable however there is noise from traffic and the trains. The shower cubicle was disgusting didn’t look as if it had been cleaned in months and parts were covered in mold
19155975,266611699,2018-05-20,142018235,Tessa,"Overall, this was a really good find! The location was a convenient walk to the DLR, the Tube system is easier to use than I had thought. I felt safe in Andrey’s location, his flat was easy to find. Andrey was super helpful, he responded quickly and I had a problem where I forgot some pills back in the States and he was really helpful (even though customs held my medications.) I’d definitely come back here or a similar area next time I want to go to London!"

Highlights included a fantastic view from the balcony and being situated in the King's Cross neighborhood, a short walk from Regent's Canal and with many amenities close by. Would be a perfect 5 star except for the fact that the concierge was not at the desk when I arrived to check in, and as such I had to wait around until someone came by and was able to let me into the building.

19545267,221977780,2017-12-28,132673531,Giorgos,"We stayed in Eleanor's place for 3 lovely months; the house, and Eleanor herself, contributed significantly to having a smooth and unproblematic stay.<br/><br/>Eleanor's place is very good value for money. <br/><br/>We felt right at home from the very beginning. The fact that Eleanor is actually living there contributed to a cosy and hospitable environment. The house was clean and comfortable (for London standards). It also has a great view. All photos shown at the time of writing are accurate.<br/><br/>The location is great for long-term stay (again, for London standards). It is close to a very convenient metro line, as well as to several bus stops that can take you in many places north of Thames quite easily. The neighborhood was very quiet and safe. Nevertheless, if staying in London only for a few days (having limited time for sightseeing), one could consider staying closer to the city center (but this would cost significantly more).<br/><br/>Eleanor is a great host. She prepared the house in a spotless manner before our stay, making sure to provide us with all necessary household items, most of which lasted for our entire stay. This saved us from a lot of fuss. Moreover, Eleanor was always quick to respond to any request, issue, or question we had.<br/><br/>Eleanor left a great ""house manual"", which included tips for running the house (heating etc), as well as useful information related to London sightseeing, places to eat/drink/shop etc.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Eleanor's place is strongly recommended. We will definitely choose it again if we ever return to London."
19566845,171363260,2017-07-17,137685495,Jessica,"Scott's communication was fantastic from the start. He made sure we had everything we needed and always checked in in case there was anything we needed to know. The flat is absolutely beautiful. Perfectly decorated with everything you could ever need. Scott left us breakfast and orange juice in the fridge for our first morning and could't have made us feel more at home. Really good transport links to Central London and a lovely walk to Greenwich which is just beautiful. Thanks Scott for opening up your home, i'll definitely be staying again!"
19566845,171916375,2017-07-19,100625138,Anchi,"這間房是單身貴族的夢想！超高科技，可以用語音控制整個家的電器，任何細節都很完美，而且還有兩個小陽台。主人非常客氣且準備周到，家裡有牛奶雞蛋麵包等等，附近的餐廳也很好吃。雖然貴了一點，但來這可以發現原來家裡也是可以這樣佈置，學到了許多！<br/><br/>It's a dream house when you are single, the details of the house are perfect and technology(must try Amazon Alexa, you can control whole house only by speaking). Everything you need, Scott already prepares, for example, milk, tea, bread, eggs, tooth brushes...anything! My friend is an interior designer, she also learns so many ideas from this house.<br/><br/>The bar and restaurant are near this house and so good! If you want a great place to stay and relax, this one is awsome! The price might a little higher, but it worth."

Aroma diffuser with lemon essential oil make a good sleeping.

If possible, we are going to choose this house again when we come to London next time."

Scott was the perfect host and has certainly given lots of thought to how he makes guests feel welcome. The complimentary breakfast meant that we weren't dashing out to find a shop but instead could enjoy a delicious breakfast.Scott was easy to get hold of and responded quickly to e mails prior to our stay too. <br/>The quality of everything in Scotts home is outstanding and certainly added a touch of luxury to our stay.<br/>Thanks again Scott and we definitely hope to be booking again soon x"

19566845,264926082,2018-05-15,115783094,Clair,"Scott place is amazing! I highly recommend this stylish and special place. I am a perfectionist yet everything was perfect.<br/>The location was superb for the O2, Greenwich and Blackheath Village. <br/>The outdoor spaces were great and the place is so peaceful despite being in a busy area.<br/>The decor is high quality and Scott is a fantastic host!<br/>You MUST stay here!"
19566845,269353949,2018-05-27,10075683,Ife,"This is an unbelievably stylish but also welcoming and warm duplex apartment. There is nothing Scott hasn’t thought of in this amazing & gadget-filled pad. It even has the perfect little sun-trap of a terrace upstairs! Great transport links and walking distance to the River Thames, Greenwich Park and market, and the O2 Arena. Sigh, truly my only regret is that I don’t live here permanently!"
19566845,271778555,2018-06-02,116266059,Louise,"Such a lovely little flat. Perfect in every way. Scott had thought of everything and everything had its rightful place. The layout of the flat is superb and all of the gadgets and instructions make it so easy. The entrance of the flat doesn't look promising, I'll admit, but once in you will find an amazing little bolthole, sparklingly clean. The location is great, with pub down the road and shops/cafes, also a nice stroll to Blackheath village for more shops/pubs/cafes and also restaurants or to Greenwich. Parking overnight is easy in roads nearby. Thoroughly recommend."
19566845,278080065,2018-06-17,170082159,Jessica,We had a wonderful time at Scott’s. The place was lovely and very comfortable. Scott was a great communicator and very kind host. We would definitely recommend others to stay with Scott! 
19566845,279367107,2018-06-20,56016041,Sarah,"What an absolute gem! The flat is indeed the perfect ‘hideaway’ and absolutely beautiful with a fantastic shower, soft sheets, great-sized TV, breakfast laid on and a fabulous roof terrace. It’s testament to how great the flat was that we still had a great time eventhough our concert at the O2 was cancelled."
19566845,281147717,2018-06-24,186842772,Suzette,"Scott was Airbnb host EXTRAORDINAIRE!  His Blackheath Hideaway was a welcome retreat for me from a busy schedule.  His communication and prompt responses commendable.  Scott has set the standard high for other hosts; decor was beautiful, complimentary breakfast convenient...much appreciated after travelling, cleanliness, way above average and outdoor terraces so inviting and of course Alexa, quite entertaining to say the least!  I loved my stay and would recommend to anyone looking for a nice cozy retreat in an area with lots of activity and entertainment with excellent access to all forms of transport.  Hope to visit again next year Scott!"

19566845,286831778,2018-07-07,137968235,吴雪,Scott 的公寓温馨而智能，在一个很安静的街区，可以步行到达格林尼治天文台，房东人很好，我们第一天入住晚于约定时间两小时，他仍非常热情的当面迎接了我们。我从他的室内装潢方面得到了很多灵感，准备用于我在北京的家里，总之，非常推荐！
19566845,294052382,2018-07-21,120583598,Renate,"This apartment is the perfect place. It is perfectly furnish and well equipped.  There is everything you need and more. We took some brilliant ideas back home to our house. It is cosy and very clean. Scott is very friendly, generous and easy to talk to. Public transport is easy with buses, the station is only 2 minutes away. If you take the train you have to consider that trains from town to westcombe park station run on longer time intervals sometimes. I can only agree with the other guests, stop looking - you found the ultimate place.<br/>"
19566845,302150855,2018-08-05,13395961,Sally,"I have stayed in many Airbnb places but this is definitely my fav. Every month or so I meet up with my best friends. We are mums who now only get the chance to catch up Infrequently. So it’s a treat and very precious time. So where we stay is equally important. Scott’s flat is amazing. It’s a hidden oasis of beautiful stylish, comfortable and sophisticated luxury. His attention to detail and kind and accommodating correspondence is second to none. The chocolates on all of our pillows  were the icing on the cake!  Cannot recommend his home highly enough. 5  stars from all over us ! "
19566845,322469144,2018-09-13,84946078,Torre Cider Co,"Scott was great to respond when booking and checking in. it is amazing the attention to detail and what has been achieved in a small space, which made it feel spacious. We couldn't have wanted for anything, breakfast items completely covered, decent coffee, fantastic bedding and a lovely shower. Clear instructions on how to use everything, wish we could has stayed longer it felt so comfortable and cosy. <br/>Great location, you can walk to Blackheath and Greenwich in about 15 to 20mins. It is near lots of small shops, bakery, pub, take aways. the entrance is down a side alley to the shops but dont be put off by the entrance as its a great surprise when you walk in. Highly recommended!"

E' davvero un esempio di come dovrebbe essere una casa perfetta dove passare un soggiorno in una città come Londra. Scott è una persona veramente simpatica e la sua accoglienza è stata davvero perfetta. Ci siamo sentiti, durante il soggiorno, veramente a casa. Che aggiungere di più? Una delle migliori esperienze fatta fino ad ora con AirBeB."

His set up is great and makes the space even more fun. He very kindly provided breakfast with fresh coffee, cereal’s and toast. <br/><br/>Overall it is clean, tidy and a stylish place that has been thoughtfully put together. Would definitely stay again, and hopefully for longer next time!<br/><br/>Rich & Julia"

The flat is very clean and beautifully furnished, and Scott has thought of everything when it comes to amenities and extra touches. The location is brilliant, within walking distance of Blackheath Village and Greenwich, and with great transport links nearby. It’s also great if you want a night in though. We cooked dinner and the kitchen is really well equipped with crockery/utensils and basic essentials. The space is warm, quiet and cosy and great value compared to a hotel of the same standard. We would love to go back. Highly recommended!"

19566845,500628619,2019-08-02,2540491,Shermane,"We were very happy with our stay at Scott's place. It's a cute, cozy hideaway with a charming decor. There are two levels - downstairs living space and upstairs bedroom and bathroom. Both levels have small outdoor terraces. Everything we needed was there. There were lots of thoughtful touches including needed items in the fridge,  Echos, host guide covering everything as well as tips for local stops. The online pictures do not capture how nice this place really is. The host was very helpful. It's easy to see why they are super hosts. The rental cost is much lower then you would expect for an apartment like this.  The location was also perfect for us. Blackheath is a charming area and walking distance to Greenwich Park and town. We definitely hope to return for a week or so next summer."

19566845,672875651,2020-10-10,34677806,Sio,"This place is fantastic. I have no complaints. Superb location, wonderful amenities and an awesome communicative host. Scott really took the circumstances seriously and made sure that I felt comfortable at check-in, which was a very simple and easy process. No faff with the keys, also. It was very quiet which meant that my friend and I had a peaceful evening. The manual that Scott kindly left for our perusal was very helpful and we quickly felt at home once we adjusted everything to our liking. The decor is beautiful. Very bright, yet not shouty colours. Everything had its place and there was no clutter. I loved the special touches of the mini chocolates left in the bedroom and the fact that Scott bought oat milk as well as dairy milk made me happy too. The place has not one, but two outside spaces which would be great to make use of in warmer months. Very cute spaces where you can sit outside with a cup of tea or some wine and just breathe in the South London air. I can't say enough great things about this place. I'm giving it 5 stars and even that feels a bit unfair!"

Kitchen is jam packed with everything you need if you’re up for a bit of cooking, there is also free coffee, tea, bread and spreads. The place was spotless and smells great. Comes with a dehumidifier and a vapour machine for all you essentials oil lovers. It’s got quite an advance lightning system that connected to Alexa through wifi so you can do some cool things with it (I’ve taken so many pictures of the transitions ). There’s also instructions everywhere so everything is easy to use plus Scott is very responsive if you need any sort of help. Im going to stop rambling now so i can I recommend this place highly. Would love an opportunity in the future to come back to the hideaway. Thanks so much Scott!"

The apartment is small but well thought out to maximise the space. There are 2 balconies, the bed is super comfy and the flat has a well stocked kitchen. I really appreciated the welcome pack too of tea, coffee, croissants and bread for toast. The chocolate on the pillow is also a thoughtful touch.<br/><br/>There are a few pubs close by that are great for food, I recommend The Royal Standard and The Hare and Billet. Scott is a fabulous host and responsive to questions and the 12 ok checkout was a big bonus for us. I’d definitely recommend this rental"

The space itself is fantastic - a really warm, comfortable, and relaxing apartment - it truly is a home away from home. Anna herself is absolutely lovely - I really enjoyed the time I spent chatting with her - you couldn't ask for a nicer and friendlier host. And the location of the apartment is great - just off the bus (and overground rail) routes - so you can get into central London very easily.

The bed is very comfy and I slept really well. If you need it to be very quiet, you might have to close the windows. There are trains passing by quite frequently. Other than that everything was perfect and I would've loved to stay longer. I will certainly try to come back soon."

The apartment has everything you need to feel at home, check-in was problem-free, and we felt very welcomed by Catherine and Dan. There's a small supermarket just a few minutes walk away if you want to cook 'at home' and some nice pubs nearby too if you want to go out. Wouldn't hesitate to book again or recommend to others."
19889129,186422888,2017-08-24,18231713,Miki,"Such a lovely place!! We really enjoyed this perfect sized house; 3 big comfy beds, a large living room with 3 couches, and a beautiful kitchen looking out to a lush and inviting garden. Right off stoke newington church street, there are so many good restaurants around like the good egg, rasa, L'antica pizzeria, the list goes on. Definitely a great find on air bnb, The pictures really don't do this home justice:)"

19889129,256180337,2018-04-22,159329322,Camilla,"A lovely place to stay, a little out of the way of the centre so not noisy at all! We were nervous about having to get a bus into the centre but it was incredibly easy getting to and from the house, even at night. Host was so helpful, leaving us tips on where to catch the bus, and local places to go. There was no shortage of food options nearby and local shops were very accessible. Would definitely stay here again!"
19889129,264654130,2018-05-14,104398851,Ivan,Stoke Newington is a fantastic and fun neighborhood and Caroline’s place is the perfect spot to explore it. It’s also an easy bus ride to central London. I highly recommend the spot.

19889129,272835512,2018-06-04,1993443,Virginia,"Wonderful location — so glad we decided to stay here. Quite spacious for the price! Loved the back garden. Mopsy the cat was sweet as can be and we were sad to leave her. Amenities/accommodations are pretty basic but we had everything we needed; enjoyed the French press and lots of natural light. Beautiful historic home in the most charming part of London. Great area to explore, easy to get to other parts of the city. Communication with Caroline was easy and we had no trouble at all. Highly recommended — a deal for sure!"
20071920,195713862,2017-09-20,4600899,Jennifer,"Great location, comfy bed, excellent communication with Jon, easy access to Pimlico tube, and unique historic building complex. Will stay again when in town."
20071920,196790935,2017-09-24,18320335,Jessica,The flat is located in a quaint neighborhood near two bus lines (24 and 10) and the Pimlico underground station.  You can also walk to the Victoria rail and train stations from the flat.  I didn’t eat around the flat but the prior guest left a note saying there was a great Indian restaurant close by.  There is a small market on Lupus Street which is a few minutes walk (on the way to Pimlico Underground station).  It was nice to have a quiet place to stay at the end of each very busy sightseeing day.  I slept on the bed which was comfy and my friend slept on the pull out sofa bed - which was also comfy.  The place was clean and the pics are an accurate representation of the flat.  The shower does not have too much water pressure in the early morning but it wasn’t a big deal for me.  Jonathan was an attentive host.  He was always available for any questions/concerns.  I would stay at Jonathan’s place again.
20071920,202926136,2017-10-13,87390242,Julie & Lee,good place to stay
20071920,205433113,2017-10-22,56096822,Mazvydas,"Pros: good location, only 10-15 min. walk to big Ben. Good wifi. Jonathan was quick to respond and very helpful.<br/>Cons: A lot of dog hair on the ground and on the sofa.  1 duvet cover was missing. Cutlery for only 2 people and we were 3.<br/><br/>To sum up- a good place for a traveling couple for a few nights stay.  Not for people with dog allergies. The place it too small for more than 2 people. Perfect for people, who want to visit London and come home just to sleep. A friendly host."
20071920,214227702,2017-11-25,106022496,Σαμιρ,"It was located in a perfect area, being at a walking distance from the city centre. The neighborhood was very quiet. At the house there was an excellent heating system. Jonathan was a very kind and excellent host, giving us all the needed directions. I absolutely suggest that place. If we visit London again, it would be our pleasure to stay again."
20071920,216209840,2017-12-03,124817692,Elisa,"The house is very pretty, small but perfect to spend a few days in London! The host was available for any problem or advice.<br/>When we arrived we found the house perfectly clean and the heaters were turned on (in december this make a difference, expeccially in London!).<br/>The house is very close to victoria coach station and it is perfectly connected to the city center (reached by a 20-minute walk, anyway).<br/>Nice experience that I wormly  recommend to everybody!"
20071920,319823649,2018-09-07,107241877,Michiel,"Our stay at Jonathan's was very comfortable. We were able to quickly make ourselves feel at home. He not only provided us with clean sheets and plenty of towels, but personal products, such as soap and shampoo were bought especially for our stay. A ""welcome basket"" greeted us on the kitchen counter. The bed was comfortable to sleep in; the down duvet and pillows, as well as cotton sheets were five star quality. The kitchen was very well equipped; we were able to shop conveniently in the local supermarket and cook for ourselves very easily in Jonathan's kitchen. The garden was sunny, private and very enjoyable. The bathroom was spacious, with plenty of natural light and space to get ready in. This charming and characterful little flat was decorated with beautiful objects and interesting items, which made our stay that little bit extra special. We found Jonathan to be a welcoming and generous host."
20071920,329678228,2018-09-29,134255380,John,We had a very comfortable stay at Jonathan’s place. It is very well located for commuting or sightseeing. All basic amenities provided at a good price - plus a massive TV! Would recommend
20071920,573446054,2019-12-06,137684883,Jackie,"Has potential to be a very “homey” type of stay. I felt I checked in and the owner of the flat was going to come home and stay with us. Everything was laid out just as someone actively staying in the home. Food everywhere, no toilet paper or clean towels, expired food in the fridge. Very responsive and quick with communication when needing a response. Location is worth it."
20071920,606462608,2020-02-16,28303776,Lisa,What a wonderful place in an outstanding location. The apartment is just a stones throw from the river Thames. The apartment was spotless and welcoming. So lovely to have a little garden to sit out in when the sun comes out. I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet it was considering the flat is in the heart of London. The host gave fantastic tips on great places to eat and see that aren't in the usual guide books. I will definitely be booking another stay at Jon's place in the not too distant future.

20090931,405409630,2019-01-27,131586463,Tim,"The location is lovely and quiet. It's right on the water in the dock, which I found cool. It's a 10 - 15 minute walk from a shopping centre and train station, which is easy and nice, but there's also a bus right outside the accomodation.<br/><br/>The place itself is modern and well furnished and looks exactly like the photos. The bed is also super comfy, and there's a big bath tub, which was nice. The shower hot water pressure isn't great though.<br/><br/>Overall I'd recommend the place! It's great value, and a really nice place to stay. I was there for almost two weeks as I looked for a place, and felt really good coming home to it every day."
20090931,411725991,2019-02-13,14048048,Cécile,"L'appartement est plutot sympa, bien equipé. Le lit est super confort ! Le logement est un peu loin de la sortie de métro mais un bus peu vous amenez juste à côté. Après la balade de 5-10min est très sympa. la vue est clairement très jolie. Le quartier assez calme dépayse de l'activité débordante de la City. J'ai trouvé Olga et son équipe très réactifs via le site. Personnellement, j'ai passé un agreable moment dans ce logement et ne peut faire autrement que de recommander. Merci !"
20090931,445396107,2019-04-29,9399277,Gustavo,"We had a great time during our stay.  The flat was great for us , 10 minutes walking to canada water station , but you can get the 199 bus at the same street . I really enjoy our time there"
20090931,457484985,2019-05-24,260641919,Sima,"Lovely little flat, clean, has all you need for short stay, beautiful views, close to shops for food and cafes in Greenland Place. Short walk to station."
20090931,460901784,2019-05-30,3776927,Jae-Yong,"Amazing peaceful place nearby a quay and the river! The access to the subway is super easy, there's an overground station nearby, and groceries are within walking distance. The whole neighborhood is a hidden gem in London, and this place was also very hospitable, clean, and quiet! 100% recommend to anyone who visits London."
20090931,481682027,2019-07-05,120472294,Audrey,The flat is very clean and bright. We found the location perfect for our time in London. The metro is a short walk away. The bus is even closer and the Thames clipper is a beautiful way to commute to London or Greenwich and a 2 minute walk away.  There are a few restaurants and two grocery stores very close by. Coffee at the Pear Tree is excellent!<br/>We had trouble checking in without data on our phones but a friendly neighbour helped with a phone call and all was sorted out.  I recommend Olga's place for a home base!
20090931,483158523,2019-07-07,140876858,Serena,The flat was really nice and clean. The host was really kind. The instructions to open the door of the apartment were not very clear.
20090931,499412987,2019-07-31,31983721,Melisa,I rent  the flat for my parents who came London to visit me. They had a great time at Olga’s place.  everything was a described  on the pictures and notes. The communication with Olga team is great. I will definitely rent the flat again.
20090931,505552096,2019-08-09,39399048,Cheryl,"Olga's place was way more than we expected. The view, historical features in every direction, walk along the Thames, so close to the bus (than underground) into the city, the water bus, and beachcombing at a low tide where we met a new friend. I want to go back!"
20090931,513290200,2019-08-19,71762072,Joanne,"The location is excellent and is situated in a nice and quiet neighbourhood. It is near Canary Wharf as well as Canada Water station,  and from there, we could get to London Bridge within 10 mins. There are several supermarkets nearby and the place itself is clean and tidy. However, we stayed there for around 10 days but the wifi stopped working after the second day (we ran out of data allowance although we never used the wifi to stream videos).  This means that we had no wifi for the rest of our stay. I contacted the host several times because there’s no way I could get my office work done without the internet, but every time I was told that their team was already “looking for a solution”. In the end, I had to change my work plans because even until the day I left, there was still no internet. Frankly, I was quite upset about how the host responded to the problem and I felt like their team never really bothered to help us. Our stay would have been so much better if there had been no such issues."
20090931,527691886,2019-09-11,87930391,Divya,"Hi, this place is perfect for short stays for an individual or a couple. However, it requires some arrangements for long term stays like space in cupboards(it was stuffed with linens and vacuum cleaner), kitchen roll, bottle opener etc. Every thing else was great. Location and views are fantastic.<br/><br/>All the best"
20090931,668527467,2020-09-27,2477892,Anya,"It was a great place! LOVED the location, almost felt like a retreat. Close to some really nice parks and loved the marinas. The only thing that was a bit difficult was the wifi, probably not the best setup if you're planning to work from the airbnb over the internet."
20090931,711590811,2020-11-27,63894068,Tunde,We had a really nice stay here. Couldn’t get the shower or intercom to work properly but didn’t really mind. I had to phone a lot for information as everything is very well integrated and I ended up not being able to find the washing machine! Very quick responses from the team who set me right :)<br/>The best thing was the views and the lovely walks along the river. It’s a great location.
20090931,715508514,2020-12-14,353468039,Esther,We had a lovely stay at the flat. Great location

20511903,516549119,2019-08-24,32630943,Karen,This is a wonderful home with an absolutely fantastic location!  Guy was very responsive with any questions that I had prior to the stay and made this  a seamless experience for our family vacation in London.  I highly recommend both working with Guy and staying at this home.
20511903,418628214442240107,2021-07-31,235948015,Charlie,"Positive - The house is centrally located. Negative - Nowhere in the descriptions does it mention the underground train runs literally at the back of the house. The photographs of the garden are extremely misleading. You can’t open the garden doors as the vents from Daphne’s restaurant flow directly into it, added to which are flies and the noise of the trains… if you want a quiet stay this is not the place for you."
20515941,191675860,2017-09-08,84780257,Nancy,"Had a great stay at Alex's house, would highly recommend this place!"

The appartment was in a super hip neighberhood and was beautiful. <br/><br/>It was an honor for us, to be her first guests! Special thanks for the great food tips, especialy the amazing thai-place! Thank u so much Amelia!"
20844051,202452911,2017-10-11,35212792,Ines,"Amelia's flat was an absolute delight.<br/>Spacious but cosy, very clean and very tidy, full of homely touches.<br/>The room was comfortable with towels provided and plenty of space to store clothes for longer stays. <br/>The location was incredibly central but the noise from Brick Lane was barely audible from the bedroom as this faces and internal courtyard of sorts rather than Brick Lane itself (the living room and kitchen face this).<br/>Amelia herself was a lovely host, giving us lots of tips and good company!"
20844051,207159636,2017-10-28,13384181,Maike,Amelia was a great host and we really enjoyed staying at her apartment. It is very beautiful and in a great location. Shoreditch is our favourite area. There are a lot of nice bars and restaurants and you can explore great street art. There are also good tube and bus connections to other parts of the city.
20844051,214604454,2017-11-26,116701223,David,The apartment was utterly delightful! Excited for the next time in London.

20844051,229744787,2018-01-25,150536380,Colin,"Amelia's place is very well located, cozy and surprisingly quiet given the location.  She was prompt and thorough in all her communication and went above what is normal to make arriving etc better.<br/>Spotlessly clean.  All in all I have a new favourite when I am in the East End of London"
20844051,235055410,2018-02-15,168718861,Martin,Amelia was a lovely host and it’s a perfect location for work or leisure. If you want a restaurant then just step out the door.
20844051,238906123,2018-02-27,43718301,Luka,"Flat is nice and clean. It was also quiet during our stay and no disturbing noises from the outside, loved that. Underground station as well all kind of shops and restaurants are all nearby. I recommend Amelia's place!"
20844051,242188093,2018-03-11,78914427,Andreia,Nous avons passé un agréable moment chez Amélia ! Rien à redire ! Les photos correspondent à la réalité et l'appartement est très propre. Malgré une proximité des commerces et des routes passantes l'appartement est extrêmement calme. Nous recommandons sans hésitation !
20844051,249990316,2018-04-03,38022190,Evonne,Amelia was very friendly and the space was incredibly clean. The rainforest showerhead is nice and the location is nice for exploring around the Shoreditch area.

20844051,264675469,2018-05-14,22235456,Federico,"Amelia is a wonderful and helpful host, always available to help. The location is perfect as it is on brick Lane, so you can just walk to the markets and enjoy the graffiti of this lively and characteristics area of London and it is really close to aldgate and Liverpool street. The flat it was clean and tidy, spacious and really cute with style! I really felt lucky to have found this place."

20844051,293045381,2018-07-19,12453448,Katharina,"Die Wohnung hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Sie ist schön eingerichtet, die Küche war sehr gut ausgestattet, das Bad modern und das Zimmer ordentlich und nicht zur Straße raus. Amelia ist eine sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin. Die Kommunikation war prima und die Check-in und -out Zeiten sehr flexibel. Wer von Stansted aus fliegt und mit der Bahn nah London Liverpool fährt, kann die Wohnung sogar theoretisch fußläufig erreichen. Wir würden wieder kommen!"
20844051,300014717,2018-08-01,195425003,Lea,"Amelia‘s flat is cosy and well located, close to the Aldgate East Station which is in Zone 1. The neighbourhood shoreditch is nice, many restaurants (especially Indian) and little supermarkets around; it seems to be an upcoming part of the city with interesting street-art and bars.<br/>Amelia was friendly and nice to chat with, we only saw her twice during our stay but she had a good solution for the hand-over of keys and gave us advice via e-Mail for brunch places. <br/>The flat is well equipped, the bedroom and the bed could be a little bigger (we were two persons) but this may be because I’m used to more space at home and it‘s totally fine for a few days. We would stay there again, thank you Amelia!"

The apartment itself was exactly like in the pictures and the location is perfect for exploring all of London on foot if you like. Can definitely recommend this room!
20844051,323950322,2018-09-16,3795065,Trina,"A great base to explore London from. Amelia makes you feel relaxed and welcome. Lovely vibes and plenty to do, but also great to chill back at the flat."
20844051,326000348,2018-09-21,53004350,Joanna,Lovely private room in a fantastic location. Amelia was incredibly flexible with the check-in and check-out process and was always available to answer questions about the area and London more generally. Fantastic host and fantastic room in a great location. Would recommend to fellow Airbnb users.
20844051,327756832,2018-09-24,136698731,Stefania,"Amelia's place is in a perfect position: 2 mins walk to Aldgate East and 5 mins walk to Liverpool Street tube stations. Perfect if you wish to live the best Vintage scene in London. House is clean and cosy and, although Brick lane is quite noisy in the week ends, the flat is in a good position where silence still reigns perfectly. I warmly suggest this room!"
20844051,328471185,2018-09-26,152109391,Danielle,A great hidden gem. The room is small but just what is needed. Very clean!! Amelia is very kind and friendly! She helped me find a place to print out my boarding passes nearby. We only stayed one night but enjoyed it very much! Thank you!

20844051,340880903,2018-10-25,33285060,Iris-Annabel,"Super sweet host, answers fast and allows flexible check in times. The flat was decorated with cool vintage pieces and felt like a place I would love to live in myself. Our room was large, bright and comfy and the bathroom is amazing as well. So was the bed and overall I have nothing to complain about. Couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay and will reccommend Amelia’s place to anyone coming to London. Best location and noise on the street was not disturbing at all.<br/>All best :)"
20844051,351612630,2018-11-23,224188873,Raghu,"Excellent place, convenient access by tube, bustling neighborhood with excellent restaurants, calm and serene. Would highly recommend this gem of a place to stay."
20844051,356192825,2018-12-07,13164208,Carmen,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Amelia's for 3 nights even if it should have been 4. We had a trouble checking in but Amelia immediately refunded us and the Airbnb service was really awesome in helping us. Anyway, she is really flexible if you need to check in late so feel free to contact her about it. The house is 5mins by foot from Aldgate East tube station and 10mins from Liverpool Street Station, we didn't catch so many buses but we saw many of them riding in the nearby. You'll be in the most vibrant and multiethnic part of London: there are plenty of restaurant (mostly Indian), bars and shops (mostly off licence that stay open at night). The room wasn't very big, we had two small cases and we had trouble moving in it because there wasn't enough space on the floor. We found hair between the bed sheets but they seemed fresh clean so I guess it was a problem coming from the blanket or from the floor, which wasn't really clean so we were forced to use socks or slippers. If you need the hairdryer make sure to bring yours or ask for Amelia's because there's no one in the room for the guests so if you need it you have to ask for it. She provides for towels but I can't say the same with shampoo or bath foam because we brought ours and didn't ask her for that. We met Amelia just once because we had different timetables and she works but she was very quiet and helpful via text messages. If you need to stay in London just for few days as we did Amelia's place is perfect because it has everything you need in order to visit the city properly."

Amelia is amazing host!<br/>The room was just enough for sleeping and the common spaces were quite nice and big for being there together.

20844051,426861852,2019-03-22,103196156,William,"Although due to our differing schedules we did not get more than a few minutes to actually meet with Amelia, the experience of staying at her flat was wonderful. She made check in extremely easy despite our late arrival and provided ample suggestions for places to eat (and all of those that we tried were excellent). Everything about the flat was fantastic, it has lovely and clean spaces as well as an overall inviting feel. The location is superb.

It was centrally located, and we felt extremely safe. Huge thanks to Nathan, and we hope to stay there again soon! "

Clean and well appointed with 4x bedrooms and a decent kitchen. Nice balcony looking East to Canary Wharf. Clean and well furnished. Only one small bathroom which might be an issue if you were using all bedrooms and needed to be out quickly in the morning. I’d stay again for sure.

Nathan was a great host and super easy check-in, would defiantly stay again."

Some very small things that could be improved: the pillows on the bed were quite lumpy, and the shower head didn’t stay in the holder (the water pressure was really strong!)... all in alll though really easy check in and out. Recommend!"
20950129,516289778,2019-08-24,79547399,Alex,"We were a family group of 6, and found the stay at Nathan's extremely comfortable! He was so responsive with our questions which was helpful. The apartment is in a convenient location to the metro, shops and restaurants. Would for sure visit again;"
20950129,541538981,2019-10-05,29737876,Vincent,The house is comfortable for 4 guest when we want to separate rooms. It's convenient，Tesco express market is just close to the building.

21131581,436705068910311247,2021-08-25,20435552,Craig,"Wo, what a fantastic location for anyone on foot in London. Every convenience one could want is within steps of the flat. Food, coffee, groceries, dinner. Kaisar met us at the flat on the day of check-in and was for consummate host. He even helped carry our bags up the stairs to the flat. A great little flat, clean, well appointed and makes you feel like you’re in a home, not a rental. Highly recommended for anyone visiting London"

21277033,203519332,2017-10-15,142813908,Richard,Flat is located very close to public transport. The local area was quiet and the checking in/out process was very easy. We attended a gig at the Hammersmith and this was ideally located.
21277033,205544390,2017-10-22,154005507,Lisa,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was a very positive one.  Sarah was helpful and friendly in advance of our stay.  The flat was in a great location, close to transport links and the shops.  It was spacious, clean, easy to find and access and quiet.  Exactly what we were looking for!"
21317696,236821424,2018-02-20,38738014,Ammar,Where do I start. <br/><br/>We needed a place for the family that was close to the hospital due to u foreseen circumstance. <br/><br/>The amazing layout of the house meant the patient wasn’t disturbed at any time    <br/><br/>The location was great. 5 min walk to Gloucester Road and South Kensington tube station. And 5 min walk to the history museum. <br/><br/>Lots of cafe and restaurants around. Private gardens for residents which was great. <br/><br/>The layout was great. Dining and kitchen on ground floor. Open plan Family lounge and dining  on first floor with balcony over looking the square and the park. <br/>2nd floor Very large master bedroom with a huge bathroom. <br/>Another family bathroom. <br/>3rd floor. A huge room with access to the roof terrace. (2 singles and a double bed). En suite with shower. <br/>Basement : another double room and a bathroom. <br/>Overall a great a few months spent here. The WiFi was very temperamental which was sorted after a few asks but worked in the end. The house was equipped better than our own home with everything we needed and more. Pleasantly surprised and happy to return. <br/><br/>All the best.
21317696,239540826,2018-03-02,53609785,Samantha,"We loved having the opportunity to share Bradley and Rachel's wonderful home and the place exceeded our expectations in every way. Fabulous attractions such as Royal Albert Hall and Kensington  Palace were all within walking distance or for the those less inclined to walk public transport was easy and just around the corner. There is no shortage of restaurants to choose from within a short  distance, and I can vouch for Bombay Brasserie being delicious. If what you want to experience during your stay in London is a home that has character and very loved (taking in their artwork and curios had us guessing about their experiences) then look no further. They were wonderful hosts who attended to our queries promptly as well as ensuring during our stay that all was well. Thank you and given the opportunity we would stay again."
21317696,253127148,2018-04-13,36753018,Abdulrahman,"The place is exactly as described, three bed rooms, living room, food table room next to the kitchen a balcony and a terrace. everything was perfect and the location is great for people that don't mind staying near the tourist places but very close (max. 15 min for most places using public transportation). I live and know the area near the place as there is everything you need near by.<br/>As I said it was a great place to stay at.<br/>The wifi was not that fast."
21317696,258121533,2018-04-28,165669414,Lucy,"Totally recommend this lovely, well equipped roomy home, in a great location.  Right in the Centre of everything but situated facing beautiful gardens."
21317696,260040974,2018-05-03,185776296,Francisco,"Great house, very spacious with room for up to 6 guests. Clean, tidy, confortable ...  just like home, if not better. Excelent situation, with easy access to all the attractions of London."

21317696,275940038,2018-06-12,41472376,Meredith,"We loved staying in the Stanhope Gardens townhouse. It gave us a real home away from home, in a lively and elegant London location. It was beautiful, quiet, green, well-furnished and equipped, in a great neighborhood, very close to the Underground, and very comfortable and relaxing. Bedrooms and baths have luxurious linens. Each bedroom is on a different level, and has its own bath on that level. The kitchen is large, sunny and well-equipped. Wi-Fi is excellent throughout the house. The house fronts right on one of London’s green squares, on a quiet and leafy street, with very little traffic.  We wished we could spend more time there. We’d love to return! "
21317696,283598364,2018-06-30,11046477,Dani,Beautiful home in a great location.<br/><br/>
21317696,287609048,2018-07-08,11217237,Abhay,"It is a nice home which is very well located too. It is in walking distance from two stations and numerous restaurants and bars. Our experience was not that great for two reasons:<br/>1. The house is over 5 levels (somehow I didn’t understand it while going through the details) and I was visiting London with my parents and climbing stairs all the time is very difficult for them. We could never use the top floor room and the terrace that was the main reason for booking the apartment. Also, because of multiple levels, each floor plate is small and doesn’t give the impression of a large house.<br/>2. There are no fans or AC in the house and we happened to visit London in a very hot week. It was really hot and often difficult to sleep. We were forced to rent out table fans to help us stay cool.<br/><br/>I hope this review helps those considering this house."
21317696,291785722,2018-07-16,17131910,Ashna,"Don’t waste your money - I had tons of issues - between no info on after hours ( you would need it if you need to know how to turn off an alarm that keeps going off - we accidentally pressed maybe the panic alarm ), we had to call that alarm company , no cops showed up. I was also advised not to use the alarm system - a very strange thing to say.  There was no welcome book with info , no info on where to throw the garbage out. <br/>There was previous renters Pringles lying out on the sofa , the shelves were dusty. WiFi was too slow. Then hostmaker sent me a handy man without an appointment. I don’t really like people entering a home I’m staying in without a fixed appointment.  <br/>I got 2 different methods of contacting  host maker  and then was asked to download an app. <br/>The house needs a deep cleaning  - removing old things like spices , sauces etc. better cleaning and definitely better communication. I definitely would not rent again and my first negative review on air n b."
21317696,295423983,2018-07-23,197628721,文杰,位置很好，是去海德公园锻炼､看鸟的好地方。离哈罗德百货很近，自然博物馆近在咫尺。超赞的房子。
21317696,318681569,2018-09-04,12115681,Kylie,"The location was lovely and house was large, however we had some serious, serious issues. The moment we entered the house we were told there was no power due to a fuse being blown, where my mother and ""hostmaker"" spent their first 20 minutes trying to fix it, there were no directions in the house manual and the car in the garage made it almost impossible to reach the fuse box. They eventually were able to fix it. Next, the wifi name and password did not match the house manual, again, we were able to find it, not a big deal, just a little odd. Finally, there ended up being absolutely no hot water for the entire 4 days we were there. We contacted the host within hours, but did not hear back from anyone for over 24 hours, and we were told a workman would come by to fix, but he never did. I find this completely unacceptable. Both me, my financé, and our moms were not able to take a shower or use hot water for our entire stay, which is absolutely miserable when you have flown in internationally after long flights and long hours or touring a large city. I've never had to write a negative review before, but I felt that other potential guests must know what could happen at this AirBnb. Also, the house is in dire need for a deep cleaning. There was dust, dead spiders and bugs, and coffee stains on walls and all over the place. Very, very disappointing."
21317696,328855415,2018-09-27,53826670,Xu,整套房子设施齐全，离房子5分钟路程内有个三线交汇的地铁站，交通便利。在居住期间反应的问题能得到快速的反馈并解决。就是有一点，房间的位置一间在地下一层，没有通风口，另有一间在阁楼，上楼的楼梯十分狭窄，大件的行李很难搬上去。整体来说，这个公寓还是很不错的。
21317696,332007461,2018-10-04,66777197,Cindy,A great home for your family to stay in London.

Super close to the next tube station.<br/>It was super clean and we felt very comfortable staying at Tom's apartment.<br/>Only can recommend staying here!
21317696,356999326,2018-12-09,194289336,Molly,"This house is an absolute gem! Spotless, extremely well furnished and a great location.<br/><br/>The beds are extremely comfortable, as is the sofa,  and it's very quiet for a central london house. <br/><br/>Within walking distance from the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, V&A and RAH.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend!"
21317696,414921162,2019-02-21,163161214,Mel,非常漂亮温暖的家，位置优越，出行方便。
21317696,423205091,2019-03-13,3087346,Roger,Be wary!  Hostmaker is attentive when you speak with them BUT never follow through. Communication issue I believe bc most of staff is friendly. We live abroad so we are pretty laidback on expectations. Literally meanest review we have posted.

21317696,525129994,2019-09-07,272507017,Atheer,"The place is great and the location is great, the problem is that it is 5 floors and the washing machine is not good"
21317696,532058447,2019-09-19,175386680,Tiffany,Generally the place was quite nice and the interior design was amazing. However after we got settled we found the bed sheets were not clean any the house keeper didn’t changed them. I sent the msg to the host to ask if we could get any help from him but I didn’t get any reply... which was quite frustrating since I thought the place was the best Airbnb I had ever booked.
21317696,538819999,2019-09-30,130886276,Javier,Very good house very well equiped and in an excellent location.

21317696,598844462,2020-01-28,87365924,Jojo,如实评价<br/>优点:房子的位置很好，附近5分钟路程就可到地铁站，到伦敦主要景点打车也很方便，周围有很多餐厅可以选择。<br/>有免费停车位，方便有租车的房客使用。房子里有很多收藏品，很有意思，感觉像博物馆，房主应该是一个很有生活情趣的人。<br/>缺点:房子老旧，卫生间维护的不好，入住时，主卧的淋浴是坏的，无法使用，主卧楼层的另一个卫生间花洒老旧漏水，也无法使用，整栋房子另外两个卫生间，一个在地下室，一个在4层的阁楼，上下楼洗澡很不方便，热水供应不够，水温也不高，冬天入住洗澡碰到很大麻烦。厨房没有使用；卧室地毯有点污渍；洗衣机需要清洁；不建议老人入住，楼梯比较狭窄，除一个卧房在地下室，其他卧房都在三楼，四楼，上下楼梯，搬运行李不方便。

21317696,611861819,2020-02-28,41610009,Sanjeev,"Please avoid this apartment till bathrooms, electrical lights in bathrooms and bedrooms, and Wi-Fi is fixed.  Out of a stay for three days we kept on coordinating with the Hostmaker team to get things fixed but till the last day things were still out of shape.  When we checked out, some of the problems had still not been resolved.<br/><br/>However the hostmaker team was responsive and did try to help, but looks like that nobody had checked if the listing accurately represented the condition of the apartment. <br/><br/>Would NOT recommend the place in spite of a lovely location and size of the apartment."
21317696,652165807,2020-08-16,120750307,Muhammad Ali,AVOID AT ALL COSTS. We stayed in the apartment for a total of four hours before vacating as we found live COCKROACHES and have been charged for two days with no refund or compensation. We found cockroaches and contacted the host at 3am and had to find alternative accommodation at that time and move across London. The host was not willing to listen to our complaint and we have had a stressful break in London as opposed to one which was meant to be relaxing. This has been escalated as a matter of urgency to Airbnb and we hope that the host seriously change their ways before re-advertising this to other customers. To make matters worse the air conditioning was non existent and the entire building was roasting. No fresh air in at all.
21317696,656937838,2020-08-27,54147428,Craig,"Tom's house is beautifully kept in a wonderful part of London. Please keep in mind that the key to access the flat is not that close to the flat, so if you have flights or tight turn around times you will need to factor this in."
21317696,659050392,2020-08-31,236690951,Tudor,"This place is pretty special, location is amazing and lovely and quiet. The pictures do not do this place justice, it makes you feel like you have your own place in the centre of London!"

21317696,713091890,2020-12-03,45966007,Amy,"Tom’s place is great, lots of space for 3 couples. Great location, short walk to Gloucester Road station.<br/>3 good size bedrooms and multiple dining tables. Had some issues with the internet speed but the host was helpful in trying to get it resolved. Definitely recommend for a stay in London"
21317696,713419199,2020-12-05,75133060,Richard,"Well equipped, spacious, quiet with a garden directly across the street and free parking at the rear of the property. Probably the best value in London."

Puro estilo británico.<br/>Con algunos puntos de mejora, como estado del mobiliario e internet (bastante insuficiente). Ideal para familia o grupos de 4-5 personas. Anfitrión de trato muy amable y rápido."
21317696,749795919,2021-04-18,139925639,Tiffany,"We absolutely loved our stay here. The home and location is beautiful. <br/>The beds and pillows are so comfortable. <br/>A short walk to the tube and an abundance of places to eat. Communication with Tom was excellent, he was very prompt to respond and very accommodating. Highly recommend. Thanks again for a fabulous weekend."
21317696,750928637,2021-04-22,151797325,Deanne,My daughter wanted an elegant stay in the run up to her wedding. This house was perfect. Thanks so much to the team.

21317696,760598738,2021-05-21,21343713,Matteo,"Great location and for me parking was key, so happy to have found this place. The property is in need of a deep clean and maintenance though."
21317696,764213573,2021-05-30,401859341,Sho,"Very good location, clean and reasonably priced.<br/>Above all, the house has a parking and helped us to visit London from afar.<br/>We would like to use it again when visiting London."
21317696,765876560,2021-06-03,48600392,Chris,Great property in Kensington. Really lovely area and such a quaint property. Really felt like a Londoner for a few days. Highly recommended
21317696,768232748,2021-06-09,130505191,Jiamin,Elegant place. Very nice location. Surprising to be such a quiet place in the city centre.

21317696,409931320087251396,2021-07-19,174446096,Michael,This is an elegant slightly quirky residence in a quiet street with gardens opposite that made the first floor lounge very pleasant to sit in. Another advantage was the parking space at the rear of the property. We were an adult family group of 3 couples and each couple had a bedroom and nearby bathroom allowing privacy when wanted. The kitchen was well equipped. Overall a great location and lovely house.
21317696,417928373401424339,2021-07-30,123237966,Richard,"The house is situated in a fantastic part of London, great transport links and the parking space is a rare find and was an added bonus in that part of town. The kitchen was well equipped and the water was hot.<br/>The bedrooms are all on different floors which range from the basement to the attic (which is accessed via a spiral staircase) and so if you have younger children I would say it's not a great layout. For us it worked because our children are all in their teens.<br/>The beds were clean and comfortable and the house, in general, was clean but certainly not spotless, which was disappointing. It also could do with some general maintenance being carried out as the main bathroom light does not work and the skirting board fell down each time the dishwasher was opened. There are some missing floor tiles in the attic bathroom which could easily cut your feet, there was mould in all bathrooms except the en-suite and the doors to the outside space did not close properly. In fact, I sliced my finger open trying to close them! <br/>We had a great time on our visit to London and would definitely recommend this property for older families or couples."
21317696,422912827465154551,2021-08-06,39149596,Louise,"Very disappointing. The property is in a fabulous location and, if we hadn't experienced the following problems I would have rated it highly;<br/>1. We had agreed a check in time of 3pm. At 11.30am on the day of our arrival I received a text message to say we could not check in until 6.30pm. We had dinner reservations at 7pm and need to shower and change. I rang the agents who were unapologetic and refused to compromise. After 3 messages they agreed we could check in at 5pm<br/>2. When we arrived we discovered 11 full black bin bags of rubbish on the lower ground floor. This is on the same level as the bedroom our son was sleeping in. They had clearly been there a while as there were flies and liquid coming out of  them. The smell was appalling. We rang and messaged the agents who simply said they would contact the host. We put the rancid bags outside the back door and nothing was done until the weekly refuse pick up 6 days later. The smell lingered in the property all week , despite us opening the windows as much as possible.<br/>3. The particulars of the property state there is a key to access the private garden across the road. We messaged the agents 4 times asking where the key was. Again, every time they said they had contacted the host.<br/>4. The sky box did not work for 4 days. The wires were mangled and my husband eventually fixed it.<br/>The property is expensive and it was very disappointing to have to deal with the above. The agents were not proactive and were, at best, unhelpful. The area is lovely although it is worth noting that South Kensington tube station is closed until Spring 2022 (Gloucester Road is very convenient though)."
21317696,424446643458454972,2021-08-08,86988450,Elaine,This was really a wee gem full of character. The location was perfect and the house was an excellent size with imaginative layout full of really interesting art. Would love to stay here again.
21317696,425889549232883066,2021-08-10,147682548,Conor,It’s a very spacious house but also has that comfortable feel. My favourite feature was the jacuzzi bath but the whole bathroom was unreal.<br/>Great location and easy to access central London
21317696,428050113257993522,2021-08-13,417344564,Nada,"Such a great find! Great location with museums, restaurants and shops all walking distance. The kids loved the beds on the top floor. Great location. Lovely square and quiet despite being so central.<br/>Would love to stay here again soon."
21317696,429432091080257721,2021-08-15,68036887,Hannah,"Either avoid this property or take a full photographic inventory of items before you arrive otherwise risk being charged for issues with items that you may have barely used.<br/><br/>I had written a lovely review about this listing shortly after check-out as my group had a great stay at this property. It was well presented and clean - as we had hoped after not being able to access the full property until 5:30 instead of 3pm due to delays with cleaning. This wasn’t a huge issue as we discussed and negotiated being able to access some of the home early as by the time we were informed of this delay, some of our group were already on their way.<br/><br/>There were some scuffs and minor damage to furniture when we arrived but we did not raise this as it did not affect the quality of our stay by any means - as long as things worked (which they mostly did, except some lights) then we were fine. <br/><br/>However it appears that not raising this on our arrival has been our downfall and the host is now levying a steep charge for “damages” including a stain to a seat which was there on arrival, a misaligned rope in a blind, and a misaligned leg on a footstool that looks like it was knocked with a vacuum cleaner, i.e before our arrival. The estimated costs are very steep.<br/><br/>We are now having to start the process to dispute these charges which has put a dampener on an otherwise lovely weekend.<br/><br/>Unless you are prepared to have to do this after your stay, I would suggest avoiding this property if you can. A huge shame after an otherwise lovely stay."

21317696,443249688486830065,2021-09-03,27771156,Christoph,"Schönes Haus, einige Punkte verbesserungsfähig.<br/>Der Einfachheit halber nachstehend die Punkte, die wir nach Abreise an den Vermieter kommunizierten in copy:<br/>great house !! However it needs some minor repairs and maintenance (several defects in the kitchen, a board / facing at the floor underneath the dishwasher falls off all the time - we tried to fix it, a few drawers don't work properly; sth. is wrong with the electric in the smaller first floor bathroom - the switch for the light is blocked rather unprofessional and a bit worrying with a tape asking NOT TO USE ist, which makes the room unusable in the evening, etc.)<br/>The nice roof garden made an uncharitable and a little bit run-down impression.<br/>The check in guidance was really bad in the first attempt - we just didn't know the procedure with the Key Nest Shop (Londis) - we would recommend to tell guests AUTOMATICALLY this prior to arrival (neighbours mentioned to spot guests like us repeatedly, dealing with the matter...).<br/>Also the WIFI-Login could be communicated better / at all / more helpful (we actually searched + identified the router an researched the LOGIN...  Furthermore the washing machine we found extremely well hidden in the garage, guests are (??) not really ment to go in... Hence another point for communication-improvement;)<br/>Last point is the lovely privat park across the street: it should be made clear, whether or not guests are allowed to use it and - if yes - where the key is located in the house.<br/>Finally: it might be helpful for some guests, to tell in advance, Sth Kensington Tube Station beeing closed until April 2022.<br/>Nevertheless: we enjoyed the week in South Kenisngton very much!   THANKS!"

21317696,447557272586859439,2021-09-09,171887641,Daniel,"All and all, an enjoyable place to stay! Great location so works well as a home base between site seeing.<br/>Has some room for improvement though. There's 4 bathrooms which is awesome, but if someone tries to use a shower while someone else is already using another one, the person already showering will have their water turned off. Also, small things like loose floor tiles in the bathroom could be updated."

21317696,457024681573513451,2021-09-22,37037112,Catarina,"I need to report 3 problems that made my family’s stay at this property very uncomfortable: <br/><br/>1) I found bits of broken glass by the entrance. This is a health hazard and particularly dangerous for my 3yr and 5yr old children who like to walk barefoot. <br/><br/>2) The cleanliness was substandard. Not necessarily in the obvious places such as bathroom sinks & toilets or the kitchen - those were ok. But around shelves, window frames, doors, radiators, ceiling fans, cupboards. <br/><br/>3) Within a few minutes of entering the property I was approached by a neighbor asking for the management contact details and relaying several inconvenient stories: the cleaner does not clean the property well and leaves the bin bags outside her door, the house had a rat infestation recently, that the owner cannot legally rent this property for more than 90 days per year and that a neighbor has vowed to sue him in court. She also told me the story of previous Airbnb guests who broke the glass by the entrance and made so much noise that neighbours had to call the police. <br/><br/>The above was too much for a short 2-night stay and brought me unnecessary hassle and worry. I reported the above to the team managing the property, they said they would investigate and nothing got done nor did I receive a reply. <br/><br/>Terrible experience."

21448170,246862269,2018-03-26,126114579,Russ,Sue's 'multicultural' abode is a very welcoming place to stay. For me it is ideally located as I am more outside of London than inside. Housemates are very considerate and there is a very friendly cat and I am a cat person so what could be better.
21448170,271140018,2018-05-31,126114579,Russ,"I returned, that says it all."

21448170,353268616,2018-11-27,126114579,Russ,Sue has a wonderful house that is full of real human comfort and contact. Everyone there is so nice and kind even the pussy cat. The garden and fish pond make this a place for nature lovers.
21448170,406925627,2019-01-31,234158866,Jürg,"Nice location on the ""country"" side of London. Shops and good restaurants are very close, Bus stop too. Trains go to Liverpool street (Stratton for changes or direct by bus) including the bus down the station you need 3/4 of an hour minimum.<br/>Be aware that you stay along with a ""family"" that is always very helpful."
21448170,431567044,2019-04-01,234158866,Jürg,You stay along with a family. Romford is a huge area with many parks and a lot of down town shopping areas.

21475119,326069319,2018-09-21,186648738,Michelle,"Good access to bus station and Oxford Street (shopping), check-in involved some miscommunication so didn't go as smoothly but other than that was a good place to stay for our first time in London"
21475119,367256489,2019-01-04,225841042,Sultan,Amazing place. Amazing host 
21475119,444790518,2019-04-28,85288044,Vittorio,Strenghtness:<br/>- Position: right in the city centre (all services nearby)<br/>- Communication/check in-out<br/><br/>Weackness:<br/>- home forniture: dated forniture - bed/bathroom not comfortable <br/>- For short travel or “just for sleep” on accomodation
21475119,461224605,2019-05-31,57944146,Vitaly,"Staid there for 3 weeks in late May. Great location for a tourist (next to Edgeware Rd, close to Marble Arch). 10 min walk to Hyde Park, Paddington Station, Selfridges on Oxford St, the Wallace Collection, 20 min to Mme Tussaud's, Regent Park, 30 min to Buckingham Palace, St James,  Piccadilly Circus, Harrods,  Natural History/Science Museum etc. 3 underground stations within a short walk plus many buses. The area looks very safe, it is well-lit. Many businesses on Edgeware road (restaurants, groceries) are open late into the night. There are 3 supermarkets (Tesco, M&S, Waitrose) close by as well as many small groceries/fruit sellers, numerous restaurants, coffee houses, 2 chain patisseries (Valerie and Paul), Lebanese bakeries, some good pubs (try Victoria), casinos etc. in the immediate vicinity. The food prices in the large chain supermarkets are certainly lower than in the smaller local stores.<br/><br/>The apartment is on the 7th floor of a 9 story building with elevator (both the building and the courtyard entrance have keyless entry by remote control fob). NB: elevators are quite narrow by American standards. The building is clean, well maintained and quiet. The flat has  a living room (with a sleeper sofa for 2), a bedroom (with a twin bed for 1), a galley kitchen and a bathroom. It is well lit and airy, has large windows facing to the East, faces a courtyard that opens into a side street, so pretty quiet for central London. 2-3 people can be comfortable there. <br/><br/>The apartment is clean, the furniture sparse but adequate, hot and cold water pressure excellent. Cooking facilities enough for occasional light cooking/reheating (2 electric burners, a microwave, a 500 mL electric kettle, a small fridge), but the area has a great choice of both sit-down and take out restaurants as well as prepared food in the supermarkets (esp. Marks & Spencer). Good supply of towels and bedsheets . The apartment has a compact washing machine that works well; there are also dry cleaners and wash-and-fold laundries within walking distance. NB: Americans should (Hidden by Airbnb) the manual for the washer, as European front-load models are very different from common American ones.<br/><br/>Alessio (the host) made sure to meet me at the door on arrival, let me in and show around. He was very nice and helpful. I had no problems during my stay so never had to ask for help, but I have no doubts he would answer promptly."
21475119,487687191,2019-07-14,87691162,Gianluca,Alessio is very nice and helpful. He made sure we were comfortable since day one and it’s very easy to communicate with him.<br/>The apartment has a great location and all the necessary amenities for a London leisure stay. I surely recommend it!
21475119,497055082,2019-07-28,135523454,Meshoo,‏If you ask me about my evaluation of the apartment. Alessio’s apartment is not good in terms of furniture is very old not good for humans. and I have pictures and evidence. as well as cleaning I had to clean towels and bed sheet. and as the windows are very dirty and the spider housing corners and walls. and the chairs can not sit on them. also there are a lot of old tables As if the apartment was a warehouse !!.  The oven in the kitchen does not work well and there is a danger to the Children of it. it has been put a sticker on the keys in the oven as unemployed and can not be used. One of the switches didn’t have sticker I switched it on and something and the oven electrocuted. and all the kitchen supplies available are from people who have already rented his apartment. He was so unpolite when we complained about the lack of toilet paper in the bathroom. sent several messages That this is not a hotel and that he took time cleaning the place and towels and chastity and that his son at the nanny and he will take from us the amount of waiting because of the delay of our trip from the Estimated arrival time. and this is not our fault and it is supposed to arrange his affairs well and does not give us the responsibility of the delay. The conversation between us is clear to all. and after he received The rent. he said he had not seen the reviews in my account if he saw it he would not agree to rent us his tattered apartment. I hoped he saw it so we would’ve not stayed in his poor apartment. We have lost our vacation cleaning and buying the deficiencies in his apartment 
21475119,512296877,2019-08-18,87526161,Tina,"Great place for the price and location.  Alessio was a great host, really friendly and helpful. Check in and out was super easy. Bed was really comfortable. Flat is bigger than it appears in the pictures too. Location couldn't have been better, had everything you could possibly need. 1 minute walk from Tesco, 5 minute walk from Marble Arch, plus lots of restaurants, pharmacies etc. Surprisingly quiet inside the flat even with windows open as well. Really enjoyed my stay, will definitely use again."
21475119,534914789,2019-09-23,66566550,Jane,"Alessio was extremely welcoming and responsive, and his home had everything one might need. It was a great trip!"

21475119,583932836,2019-12-29,204004596,Sergio H,"Alessio is an excellent host! Although we had a difficult check in date (Christmas) he could manage the keys delivery very effectively. The place has also an excellent location, even though London is quite a huge city! We’ll definitely consider this accommodation when being back in London"
21475119,589548821,2020-01-06,32295047,Mohamed,"Communication with Alessio(host) was super easy and he was very responsive and helpful all the way from booking till the end. Check in was smooth, on time and easy. The apartment has an amazing central location with all services provided nearby. Next to edgware road and marble arch and easy access to underground station. Just a 5 minute walk to Hyde park and paddington station and a 10 minute walk to oxford street. The only weakness about the apartment would be the outdated furniture(which is mentioned by the host beforehand in the listing) but other than that everything we needed was provided in the apartment. I would definitely recommend this apartment for its great price, amazing location, and superb host."

The furnishings are modern yet with character. The layout of the 5 BRs is great for a multi family holiday or just having some privacy from each other. Most rooms have their own bathroom and all fully renovated. We had a great time and hope others will share our great experience. We hope to be back soon!"
21640133,217198396,2017-12-08,6885257,Yiqun,"Jenny is a very nice host, her and her team response quickly and very helpful! The apartment has perfect loction and living envioment, cross the street there is a waitross and many restruant. <br/>The apartment is very suitable for family or big gruop to stay, my friends and I are very like to stay here. the living room which on secong floor is perfect for family time! the Kitchen is absolutly excellent and modern! <br/>there are only two thing cause inconvenience, frist, the bathroom on the frist floor is facing to the outward door, the outward door is made by wood and clear glass which people on street can see inside. this cause my friend inconvenient after shower in the night time. my advice is you may install a curtain behind the outward door. second, the toilet room's automatic induction lamp on the third floor will lighting-off every ten seconds, I have keep my body moving while I was in toilet.<br/>hope Jenny will improve those two things. besides these I still very enjoy my stay and if I ever came back to London I will still choose this apartment."
21640133,217901677,2017-12-10,148168890,Jeff,"This is an amazing place to stay while in London and is highly recommended by all my family. The 5 bedrooms are spacious and if like us there are ten of you there is plenty of space and the 4 bathrooms make life easy. There are plenty of amenities in the area both for shopping and eating out. Public transport is easily accessible, if you are going to use it I would suggest buying an oyster card, it makes life easier for travelling. The house is exceptionally clean and tidy and we could find no fault with it. Congratulations to Jenny and her team, including Biai who was there to greet us. We plan a family trip every year and we would definitely consider staying here, especially as the grandchildren now prefer it to staying in a hotel."
21640133,228908975,2018-01-21,62945208,Colette,"Couldn’t recommend more! <br/><br/>We stayed at Jenny’s place for a family members birthday and the house was perfect for our big group. All bedrooms, bathrooms, living room and kitchen were spotless and the fresh bunch of flowers in the kitchen was a very nice touch. Good location with restaurants, supermarkets and tube stations were all within walking distance. Jenny was very attentive throughout the booking process and leading up to our stay. High praise for the extremely comfy beds too! Will be back."

21640133,230512394,2018-01-28,159703393,Janine,"Beautiful accommodation, very comfortable, stylish and spotlessly clean. The house is a short walk (less than 10 mins) from Paddington station which was very convenient, there is an abundance of cafes and restaurants within a minutes walk. Both tube and bus stops were a short distance from the house. Queensway tube was on the central line and just 3 stops from Bond St (near Oxford St), the bus stop on Bayswater Road (at the bottom end of Inverness Terrace) runs along Hyde Park and was a short ride to Oxford St. The house is well positioned for a morning run to/around Hyde park (great running without having many roads to cross). The street the house was on is one-way so  not much traffic noise, it was very quiet at night. The beds were huge and very comfortable. Jenny and her team were excellent, they replied to any queries speedily and were all very accommodating/helpful. I will definitely use this property again if travelling in a large group to London."
21640133,231432529,2018-02-01,146489937,Debbie,"What a beautiful home, can’t fault the house at all. It was exactly as described.  We were on a work trip and having this home to come back was a lovely end to our day.  Plenty of bedrooms and bathroom we all had our own space. I have rated this house 5 Stars. I will definitely be booking again in the future."

The amenities were complete and easy to use.  The location was convenient as it is a short walk from the underground stations.  <br/>Overall, we enjoyed our experience in London even more because this lovely place was a part of it.<br/>Thank you Jenny!"
21640133,242043886,2018-03-11,66954282,Helen,"The apartment/house was AMAZING, exactly as in the photos. We stayed here for the weekend for my hen do and was perfect, we were able to eat and socialise in the kitchen/diner and then relax in the lounge. There were plenty of bedrooms, bathrooms, chairs, cutlery etc for everyone. The beds were really comfy and the bedding was super soft. The accommodation is about 5-10 mins walk from the tube and the parking with the flat was secure and safe, definitely an advantage in London. Everyone on the hen do commented how brilliant the house is, we would definitely stay again in the future. As there was a large group of us, it worked out very good value for money, especially considering we were staying in Central London. Had a fab weekend, made better by having somewhere amazing to stay."
21640133,246813619,2018-03-26,165916744,Kathryn,"This townhouse is fantastic! We absolutely loved our stay in this conveniently located, fabulously outfitted home in Bayswater.  The neighborhood is incredibly convenient with great restaurants, super markets and tube stations.  There are three lines within walking distance and Paddington station so you can get anywhere pretty quickly.  Jenny has done a terrific job having meaningful extras available in the house such as hair dryers in the rooms, Netflix access and soap and shampoo in the bathrooms. The kitchen was well stocked, there are quality bath towels and bedding in the rooms and a nicely designed, comfortable living room for relaxing in the evening.<br/><br/>We had a great time with our family touring London and relaxing at Jenny’s place when we returned after a long day."

21640133,266605381,2018-05-20,27061713,Bryce And April,"The house was beautiful and the photos showed exactly how it looks.  We enjoyed our time here.  Jenny was an excellent host and responded to questions quickly.  Check-in and check-out was easy and they were willing to work around our schedule with our flights.  The neighborhood is cute with lots of restaurant options.  A grocery store is right around the corner, and a quick walk to the tube or train station.  We highly recommend and would stay again."
21640133,277390585,2018-06-16,166905104,Anand,"Great location, so close to Hyde Park, 4 different underground stations, bus stops, lots of good restaurants and services close by. Worked out very well for our huge family. Jenny and all the folks helping her were super responsive. The cleaning crew was awesome, they found some money left behind and let us know via Jenny right away.  Thank you Jenny!"
21640133,319009185,2018-09-05,13543679,Shannon,"From start to finish, Jenny and her team provided a first-class experience for my family during our recent London visit. The house is gorgeous, exactly as pictured, great for accommodating large groups, and perfectly located for a wonderful time of exploring the city. I especially appreciated Jenny's prompt assistance in arranging transportation from the airport to the house! So helpful for a large group. We will definitely keep this place in mind for future London stays and would highly recommend to others."
21640133,324006169,2018-09-16,167409627,Judy,"First the good:  the location is fantastic within easy walking distance of restaurants, groceries, shopping, and multiple tube spots.  The flat itself is very nice-up to date, modern, and upscale.  5 stars for everything location and flat related.<br/><br/>The bad: The host double booked the first night, and lied to us (and continues to do so) about a non-existent plumbing problem that forced us to an alternate location on the first night.    We know she is lying because after that first night when we were transferring from the alternate location to the primary, we found 8 Germans being hustled out earlier than the normal check out time.  Who reported no plumbing (Email hidden by Airbnb) plaint filed with Airbnb."
21640133,327796637,2018-09-24,7515629,Rory,"This is a really nice apartment in a great location. Easy to get around and loads of shops and restaurants close by. Beautifully appointed and comfortable, we would only make two negative comments. There is a lot of traffic noise at night and the water pressure is quite low so the showers are not great. The rest more than makes up for this. A really nice sitting area and the kitchen is great. All the bedrooms are top class with very comfortable beds."
21640133,417747383,2019-02-28,21265853,Maya,"The place of Peter and Jenny is beyond my expectation. I travel with big family of 10 includes my elderly parents and my small 3 yo son. The house fit us all well. Its a very beautifully decorated home, clean, fresh and vibrant. Toilet, kitchen, laundry are well equip. The location is strategic too, all are walking distance for supermarkets, restaurants, souvenirs, the tube station, the park and etc.<br/><br/><br/>The arrival and checkin is convenient too. Peter and Jenny duty manager's  assist and help kindly upon our arrival and the entire stay. <br/><br/>I like so much that Jenny has fast response for any questions or request. It helps so much on our day to day request. <br/><br/>Overall, we are so happy to stay at Peter and Jenny's place. Worth the price of the place. We definitely will stay at Peter and Jenny's place again shall we travel again in big groups.  Your place is highly recommend, and I shall rate your place as 5 stars.<br/><br/>Thank you so much Peter and Jenny for being a wonderful host to us all!"
21640133,418124696,2019-03-01,1245194,Susann,"This home is outstanding! Having an entire house with even a parking space seemed to be a great deal... even more, it was spotlessly clean. A designer did an amazing job, each detail is placed so well, each furniture item is comfortable - the beds are superbly comfortable. Jenny provided a lovely welcome package for our group of 10 which we believe is very thoughtful. The kitchen has everything we could hope for, we enjoyed the eat in kitchen, half of our group cooked whereas the other half enjoyed watching us from the dining area... very relaxing. The neighborhood was great - everything you could need was just round the corner, an extremely good Waitrose supermarket, breakfast cafes, juice shops, restaurants, and public transportation. Jenny is very attentive, the check-in process was seamless.  I highly recommend this fantastic Townhouse."
21640133,464686674,2019-06-06,88470245,Jazz,"Beautiful house, well decorated and easily accessible by tube to central London and by foot to Paddington Station.<br/><br/>My colleagues and I enjoyed are stay and I would recommend for any groups looking to stay in the area.<br/><br/>Hosts were helpful, but note there is a 30 minute check in slot to meet the host (which you pick) but not the option to self check in as advertised."
21640133,465187027,2019-06-07,16146850,Sean,"This is a lovely home with all of the amenities you would want hope for.  It was clean, well appointed, and very comfortable for our group of 5.  The location is excellent, with dining, shopping, and the tube all within a few blocks walking distance.  Highly recommend for your stay in London!"
21640133,520322809,2019-08-30,74518674,Abdulraman,"My family and I loved this place! It looked just as beautiful as the pictures, and the location is really nice. I wasn’t too exited about the location thinking it was a bit far from some popular attractions but it turned out to be great. You got lots of restaurants and coffee shops right outside your door and the area is very safe. The beds were huge and comfortable, and the rooms smelled amazing which created such beautiful welcoming, relaxing feeling. The communication is by far the best I’ve had on Airbnb, Jenny was so responsive and helpful. We asked for 5 fans and when we got back we found a fan in each room. My favorite part about this listing is the host! We needed a last minute accommodation and Jenny was the perfect host! I was lucky to find her place. We had one of the smoothest check-in’s less than 3 hours after booking, everything was spot on! Don’t hesitate to book with jenny and peter they will ensure you have a pleasant and comfortable stay."
21640133,527643095,2019-09-11,259760364,Jiyoung,"Thank you for your kind and complete support. Especially, I asked for 2 or 3 hairdryers because there are several women in my group, and you prepared a pretty good product in every room! I was impressed. You has always offered active and prompt replies and solutions to all questions and requests. Thank you for giving my family special memories."
21640133,531837587,2019-09-18,183027787,Sharon,"The London Flat was amazingly spacious and was conveniently located to a good choice of restaurants, supermarkets and the London Tube stops.  The place itself was clean, very well kept and provided more than enough space for my group of 7 people.  I would highly recommend this place and if back in London I would defiantly book it again.   But the best part was the flexibility and friendless of Peter, Jenny and team.  They were very helpful before, during and after our visit.  A great group of people who provided great customer service and made our trip a fun and relaxing one.  You can’t go wrong in selecting this place for your next stay in London."
21640133,554448659,2019-10-26,6385862,Erik,Amazing place - and the description matches reality. I have saved this location for use on a future trip.

21640133,589616856,2020-01-06,273897670,Joshua,Thank you for such a beautiful home. Made us feel like at home while visiting London. Such a big space for me and my family of 8!
21640133,591923183,2020-01-12,179128802,Mollie,My family had an amazing stay at Peter & Jeanny's beautiful home which was in a great location in London. It's close to 2 underground stations with plenty of good restaurants & stores around the corner. <br/>The house was extremely clean with all the amenities we needed for our visit. The decor is very cute & welcoming! <br/>Peter & Jenny were very communicative throughout the whole experience (pre-trip & during the trip). I'd very much recommend their house to anyone traveling to London with a big group/family. We loved it!
21640133,597808990,2020-01-26,75683081,Loredana,"The apartment was very cosy, the rooms are big, comfortable beds, well equipped kitchen and great lounge area. Everything was so clean and the house was beautifully decorated. The communication with the host was great! <br/>Everything was perfect and as described. You will not be disappointed."
21640133,602646623,2020-02-07,33536499,Torquil,There is a great supermarket kitty corner from the house and Kensington Gardens is 8 minutes’ walk away.
21640133,608722977,2020-02-21,18164909,David,"We very much enjoyed our stay in London in this townhouse. The positives include a lot of space, a very functional kitchen, an extremely good Waitrose grocery store less than a block away, and nice finishes throughout the house. It’s not the fanciest block in London, and it’s kind of in a neighborhood no-man’s-land (although close to Notting Hill). And most of the top attractions in the city are a good tube or taxi ride away - so be prepared to head out for the day and not return until after dinner. But we found the space, the cleanliness, and the amenities nearby to be well worth some commuting across town. <br/>Very much recommended."
21640133,612851426,2020-03-01,14492741,Max,The place was great to host me and my friends for a weekend in London. Specious flat and all 9 of us slept comfortable. Location is central and tube station is easy to reach by foot. Communication with host and guest managers is smooth and they are very attentive. Can recommend the place to others.

21640133,617592843,2020-03-13,322753996,Anju,"Peter and Nicolas were both very polite. Home was gorgeous and large, nice location as well."
21640133,619025708,2020-03-16,14371927,Edward,Fantastic spot. Would stay again
21640133,624654456,2020-05-13,131876903,Sam,This Apartment was one of the best I’ve been in. The only problem was the smell of drains. Besides that everything was amazing
21640133,637210969,2020-07-12,86305337,Hassan,"Absolutely beautiful place and extremely clean. Could not have asked for anything, service was brilliant."
21640133,770474424,2021-06-14,11767875,Robyn,"Peter and Jenny’s house was perfect for our stay, it was very spacious and clean and a great location.  Check in was easy and everything we needed was provided - toiletries etc."
21640133,449742944718777167,2021-09-12,94295840,Darren,"Only a 10 mins walk from Paddington Station and 5 mins to Hyde Park and surrounded by many local amenities - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose and just about every coffee shop you like including some excellent independents especially the Grainier Bakery<br/><br/>Really convenient if you are flying into Heathrow and then take the Heathrow Express.<br/><br/>The property is EXCELLENT but for us having a 5 bedroom apartment with 2 ensuite bathrooms was important. The living space was very practical for our business meetings but also comfortable when the business was done. We were also able to use the screen sharing on the TV. <br/><br/>Inside the house is very impressive and Peter and Jenny were super responsive on answering messages on either WhatApps or the notice AirBnB messaging. <br/><br/>A beautiful house"
21640133,477326888748113748,2021-10-20,45437957,Katerina,"My family and I had a great time staying in this lovely house. We were very comfortable as the house was very spacious, clean and everything was well thought out. The location of the property was good for us and would definitely stay again if we return to London. <br/>Previous to arrival, communication was amazing! Advice was given about a convenient car park too! Our friendly and polite host met us at Check in and explained everything we needed to know about the property before leaving us to it. <br/>We loved our stay, thank you!"
21725560,510474146,2019-08-16,270342292,Nour,"The apartment was lovely, it was very cosy, clean tidy and very modern.<br/>Extra credit goes to the location, there were many shops and parks nearby.<br/>The Agent was very kind also and she was always there on time for check-in and check out.<br/>We would definitely rent the same apartment for our next visit to London"
21725560,562786705,2019-11-11,160719386,InKwon,"Earls Court역에서 도보로 3분이내, 방 2개, 샤워실, 부엌 잘 준비되어 있음. 물 잘 나오고,  세탁, 조리 등도 잘 할 수 있음. 실제로 사람이 사는 곳이라 유지 보수가 잘 되있음. 주변도 안전함. 역에서 가까워 이동에 무리 없고 Earls Court역은 한국의 서울 신도림역, 옥수역 처럼 지하철 노선이 겹치면서 시내 접근성이 좋은 곳임. 강력 추천할 만한 곳임. 단 엘리베이터가 없음."
21725560,583929435,2019-12-29,308735082,Carlos,"Muy buen sitio. Limpieza y ubicación inmejorables! El staff the Under The Doormat son muy agradables y sus respuestas son todo lo rápidas que puedes imaginar. Cuando vuelva a Londres, intentaré volver al mismo sitio. 10/10"
21725560,616932536,2020-03-11,211887132,Marina,"This place is small but has everything you need.  The rooms are bright and it's obvious it is someone's home, not just an impersonal space.  The kitchen is well equipped for cooking, if that is something you like to do.  The location affords easy access to buses and the underground, food shopping and dining out.  Cafes and pubs abound, and the area is busy at night so we felt safe on the nights we stayed out late.  Check in was fast and check out was punctual and easy.  Under the Doormat were very accommodating with special requests."
21725560,454862340243866938,2021-09-19,1941402,Christina,"Booked this for my sister. <br/>She wrote the following of her stay:<br/><br/>The flat was spacious enough for one or two people, with earls court less than a 4 minute walk away which is very convenient if you’re going anywhere in London. Area can be quite expensive, bathroom and kitchen sink cupboard wasn’t cleaned prior to arrival and the flat could get very hot, very quickly (it’s an attic apartment) so often had to keep the windows open. The apartment itself is on the third floor and there’s no lift so I’d advise to pack light when coming for a stay. There’s an interim cleaning service that comes once a week which is handy as they don’t give you a key to the bin store that other residents in the flat have. Most of the people I spoke to in the underthedoormat were lovely."
21725560,474445019320240222,2021-10-16,13983836,Amy,"Will stay with them again, excellent customer service, really nice flat, everything is managed nicely. Will definitely stay with them again on our next trip."
21744572,224814440,2018-01-04,54154296,Lucy,"Jorge’s apartment was in a great location if you want to visit Hyde Park. It’s in a very safe and secure building with a doorman. The bedroom does back onto a very busy road so it can be quite noisy at nighttime, but I suppose that’s the trade off for staying somewhere busy. While I never met Jorge, he was helpful and responded quickly to emails, he also organised his lovely friend to check us in when we arrived. Thanks Jorge."
21744572,253394087,2018-04-14,118346654,Julie,"This apartment is in a great location close to the Marble Arch underground and Oxford St. It's clean, warm and the bed is very comfortable. A lovely little homely haven in a busy city."
21744572,255704971,2018-04-21,3830989,Jessica,"Couldn’t have been happier with this spot. Exceedingly convenient. I can’t emphasize how big a deal it is to be within a very short and pleasant ~12 minute walk of Paddington Station (where the Heathrow Express stop brings you, and where I was able to make an easy day trip to and from Wales).<br/><br/>I really liked the apartment too. Lots of thoughtful touches like AC adapters, and a Bluetooth speaker. A nice bathtub which is rare in London. I was happy for my nights in. <br/><br/>Other reviews are right, the apartment is loud. But closing the windows really quiets things. A couple nights I used my ear plugs, but not most nights. If you were someone very sensitive about privacy the lack of curtains in the living room might be a deal breaker but I personally loved it. Such great light and a great feeling of being immersed in the city. <br/><br/>Great restaurants and a brilliant little middle eastern grocery store were virtually at the doorstop. Lovely to have Hyde Park right there and all the shopping and food on Oxford. I didnt even need to use my Oyster card till my last day."
21744572,272859432,2018-06-04,17018793,Jackie,"Jorge’s place was central, well-stocked, and safe- everything we wanted for our 3-day stay in London!"
21780105,223523976,2018-01-01,126766950,Chathuranga,Need to have good knowledge about public bus roots and oyster card otherwise it will be difficult to go city. Anyways place is quite better to stay. No disturbance
21780105,230557992,2018-01-28,90270202,Lizzie,Lovely host! Very welcoming.
21780105,263147381,2018-05-11,101705428,Alex,"Very pleasant place to stay. Great value and Anne and her family are very welcoming, warm and relaxed. Very comfy bed as well. Highly recommend and would definitely stay again. Thanks!"
21780105,292899882,2018-07-19,76450240,Pierre-Marie,The owner was really welcoming and friendly. 10/10 would recommand
21780105,354034835,2018-11-30,215153882,Nicholas,"Very friendly host, Happy to give you space but equally happy to talk.  House is always warm and generally quite at night."

21780105,546963007,2019-10-14,300300017,Omar,"Anne is very lovely and nice, the place is very clean! Close to buses and rail"
21780105,588240889,2020-01-04,193012715,Sultan,"Anne place felt like home, she is a very lovely, welcoming, helpful and nice woman, her place is in a very quit neighborhood, very close to bus stations ( 5 min walk), also close to parks.<br/>Had a blessing time there."
21780105,611861480,2020-02-28,326750711,Mohamad,"Anne is the most warm and wonderful person you could meet. Lovely house, great location, very peaceful especially at night and yet so close to train station and bus stops that can take you into the heart of London. Again the house is really nice, warm, clean comfortable and Anne is one of the most decent people I have ever met. It was my best stay and experience so I feel I have to make a point of it. I was made to feel so welcome and my stay was so comfortable. As I was staying for three weeks this was a very great relief as not all of my stays were as nice as this. The amazing thing is how little she charged for what I received! I had to mention that to her before I left because for the type of accommodation in the house and area that Anne provides the price is extremely cheap. This has got to be one of the best Airbnb deals out there. Thanks again so much Anne for my best experience!"
21815208,213214913,2017-11-20,150185000,Steve,It‘s the best house i have lived. The traffic is convenient. The house is very nice. I must give 5 stars.

21815208,238176644,2018-02-25,168313570,Mirjam,Beautiful flat in a lively neighbourhood. I higly recommend this place to other visitors.
21815208,240555461,2018-03-05,43164657,Michal,Very nice apartment. Clean and comfortable. No unpleasant surprises. A bonus for guests who like oriental food and english pubs - you can find both in one place - just around the corner ;)
21815208,241467139,2018-03-09,158146574,Julie,"This is a great apartment, the outside is deceiving as the inside is fantastic. Clean, spacious, comfortable and everything you need for a week away from home. Felt really safe here too, the area is really nice. Straightforward to check in and great communication. Thank you so much!"
21815208,242837706,2018-03-13,172635735,Midori,"Great location, beautiful flat and lovely pub under the flat. I just wish the flat owners knows which of their properties I'm going to stay tonight and explained to me well about the equipments of flat. I wasn't comfortable when I check in as I found the key on the door and I have to do the same when I left the flat (never seen the owners in person). I wanted to meet the person just for 3 mins so that I have to ask everything, receive a key and done, instead of exchanging so many emails and phone calls."
21815208,244203960,2018-03-18,170739552,Bent,Very nice apartment and good location.
21815208,245413229,2018-03-22,7111039,Art,"This was an incredibly amazing place!  It was very spacious, very stylish, and close to everything.  The building was very quiet, and little touches like the heated floors made you feel very comfortable.  <br/><br/>I will definitely look to stay there the next time I’m in London!"
21815208,247387164,2018-03-28,168723566,Oliver,Really nice place and location. Absolutely recommended it!

21815208,250856277,2018-04-06,29672750,Bernard,"In my opinion this place is even better than what you can expect from pictures; clean and comfortable, brand new quality equipments; plenty of hot water, comfortable heating system and nice bath rooms; comfy bed, excellent wifi; and so convenient to public transport and lots of nice restaurants and of course the famous Borough market."
21815208,252633277,2018-04-11,173941405,Beat,"Spacious apartment on very good location. Unfortunately poorly cleaned (quite dusty floor).  Communication was good with quick replies, on site rather shortspoken on the phone."
21815208,254337295,2018-04-16,132463263,Thomas,"The flat was very nice.  The hosts got back to you promptly and one even lives on site that could assist quickly. <br/> Where we were was a perfect place to grab a bite to eat, walk around and walk to the Tube. <br/>The place was clean and spacious even with 7 people. <br/><br/>I would have liked to known about the club  music that was on Saturday night.  Normally the music would have a an early cut off time (2AM) but this went on to 6:30 AM.  The noise made it difficult to sleep if you are in the back two bedrooms. Luckily it was only one night."
21815208,256639672,2018-04-23,167724018,Camilla,Vi var mycket nöjda över lägenheten. Nära till tunnelbanan och restauranger. Lätt att ta sig till allt. Snabb respons på meddelanden till värdarna och snabb hjälp då vi hade några frågor. Vi rekommenderar varmt andra detta boende!
21815208,258502380,2018-04-29,83434240,Maria Clotilde,"Posizione eccellente, appartamento grande pulito senza moquette  (vantaggio x gli allergici )"
21815208,267955042,2018-05-23,166648992,Bente Dokken,Leilighetet ligger sentralt til med lett tilgang til det aller meste i sentrale London enten til fots eller med undergrunnen. Det var lett og finne frem og verten var gjestfri og sørget godt for oss mens vi var der. Leiligheten var fin og ren.
21815208,282481538,2018-06-27,180715805,Shankar,"This place is exactly as described - clean, neat, well located and a 3 minute walk to the Southwark tube station. It had all the amenities required and there are many stores nearby for your grocery needs.  We enjoyed our stay and will surely use it again when we get the chance. Pls note that they do not have a separate dryer for the clothes."
21815208,435442571,2019-04-10,83891352,David,"Location , location, location! Staying at this flat was a delight . Every location I needed to go to was just around a 20 minute car ride or less. The flat decor was also modern & stylish .Would definitely book again in the future."
21815208,454987323,2019-05-19,56941972,Sydne,"The location for this place is ideal! Very close to the train station and walking distance from many pubs and restaurants. However, ammenadies were missing including extra TP and hand soap, which is very unsanitary. Thankfully we only really stayed there one night."
21815208,469769936,2019-06-15,50028208,Daniel,"Our family of 5 (3 kids < 13) stayed here 3 nights.<br/><br/>The flat is in a good location near the Southwark train station and some restaurants and pubs. It is located above a pub and directly across from train tracks. The pub can get loud at night and noise from the train can be an annoyance if you’re a light sleeper. The living room has two sofas that covert into a flat surface; not recommended for sleeping as they are quite uncomfortable and do not accept fitted bed sheets. Also important to note that the mattress in the master bedrooms sags.<br/><br/>The two bathrooms were adequate for our family, however, we could only use one shower. The handle to the faucet was not attached and I didn’t feel comfortable trying to repair it. Last item to note is the toilet seat in the master bathroom. While they normally attached via two screws/bolts, this was only attached with one and caused the seat to shift."
21815208,535754277,2019-09-25,295043884,Rob,Great stay!

21815208,462776563846843790,2021-09-30,2132586,Lorna,"Thanks Amy, very centrally located apartment with great pub downstairs (which you can’t hear at all)"

21815208,465717021340403776,2021-10-04,24705437,Sharan,"Wow! This place was so clean and organized. We recently moved to the UK for school & came to London for a quick weekend getaway before school started. We had a horrible experience at another Airbnb & booked Amy’s place for the rest of our stay. She was so understanding and let us come drop off our stuff before check in so we didn’t have to carry our luggage around. The place was so clean, with lots of natural light. We will definitely be staying there again. Thank you!"
21815208,473736321685971205,2021-10-15,7419284,Moz,"Lovely, spacious flat in a great location. 2 good sized bedrooms one with a large bed and en-suite and the other with a pull out double bed . There is another separate bathroom down the hall. <br/><br/>The flat is in easy reach of Southwark Tube, London Bridge and Borough Market. It was something of a home from home for me as the flat is directly above an Irish Pub  No problem though as the noise is minimal and if you say your staying in the apts you get 10% discount  Does great Thai Food too .  Amy is really communicative and helpful and for a £50 charge allowed me to check in early on the day . Spotless clean it was a great base and I’d certainly stay there again ."
21815208,475184546749165288,2021-10-17,139797562,Lucy,"Clean and comfortable apartment. Had a few check-in issues as the cleaner was scrambling around trying to get the rooms ready despite us arriving at 3:50 (only 10 mins early). A couple of small improvements could be made eg. fixing wobbly toilet seat in en suite, provision of hand towels and bath mats. Value for money could be better as paid a lot of money but was left slightly disappointed in quality of 'VIP' apartment. Good location otherwise and railway didn't disturb us too much."
21815208,475884140138072607,2021-10-18,187445165,William & Hannah,Location is fantastic and the place is lovely. Easy check in and spotless.

21815208,483826540289462254,2021-10-29,299228971,Jonathan,"Just what we needed in London - as we visited the Imperial War Museum and various other bits and bobs. No distance from the tubes and loved the street market food in Elephant and Castle - so much to do within this location. Apartment was perfect for our stay - clean, tidy and well appointed"
21815208,484573411563721176,2021-10-30,429273616,John,All fine thank you

21832694,225137131,2018-01-05,162183340,Philippe,Avons passé une semaine durant le jour de l'an. Tout était parfait. Sarah est très réactive et aux petits soins. Jolie petite maison indépendante à deux pas du centre dans un quartier très calme. Idéal pour visiter Londres.
21832694,282114337,2018-06-26,58536337,Donna,Future travelers can expect to get some good tips from Sarah and Gerard and she is wonderful with communication. This place is pretty close to London Tower helps a lot in planning and sightseeing.
21832694,288585793,2018-07-10,171810773,Timo,"Good location close to Bakerloo and Northern lines, easy and fast to reach everywhere in London. Quiet neighborhood. Nice and very private garden. Good kitchen but no room for a kitchen table. "
21832694,293520793,2018-07-20,3127922,Fiona,Great place - was very happy with all the help she gave us; including early check in and quick responses to any questions we had. Even before we arrived she was as helpful as could be. Thanks again. 
21832694,295787449,2018-07-24,25256957,Jennie,"At this fantastic listing, classic London meets modern amenities. The home is only a short walk from the Elephant & Castle tube station, and after a day of exploring it was wonderful to come back to the beautiful garden. The neighborhood is full of easygoing pubs and fascinating museums (the staggering Imperial War Museum is less than a ten-minute walk away). Sarah and Mitch were always so kind in their quick responses to us, and we can't wait to stay here again! "
21832694,308846117,2018-08-17,75485565,Sarah,"Sarahs place in London was a great find.  The location is perfect.  We walked to South Bank, Covent Garden and Oxford Stree.  We like to walk, it takes about 20mins to get to South Bank, but its an easy route.  There was also easy to access the tubes, we took a cab back for ease in the evenings and it was around 15GBP from the West End.  There is a greta local food market - with craft breweries etc near by that you should definitely visit.   Sarah was a greta host, she met us and showed us round the property, gave advice on what to do and was really responsive throughout.  It is unusual to get a whole house in London.  The rooms are therefore smaller than you would see in homes in the US, it is cosy and had everything we needed for my husband and two daughters.  Also, it was a really quiet location, which is often not the case in London.  I would really recommend staying here. "
21832694,313348559,2018-08-25,26666635,Huaxi,房东很好很热情，亲自接见并开门给我们介绍屋内的设施，房子的花园有一个大按摩浴缸，很赞。房子很干净，停车方很方便。
21832694,315242243,2018-08-28,67859540,Maged,"Amazing place with a great back yard and a hot tub, very quit and safe area, walking distance to 2 underground stations and a big Tesco. Sarah was a great host  wry helpful and understanding. Easy check in. Definitely will return back when I’m in london again."
21832694,319475159,2018-09-06,200186755,Margaret,Loved the location on a quiet street close to public transport. Very warm welcome  and the hot tub was a fun addition to our stay. I recommend this house.

21832694,324485636,2018-09-17,195827344,Michelle,"This 2-bedroom townhouse is about a 5-minute walk to the Elephant and Castle station. This puts it outside of the typical tourist area but makes it easily accessible. The best features of the place include 1) the garden, 2) it's very quiet, 3) fully stocked kitchen, and 4) lots of thoughtful touches like international power adapters and some breakfast food for the morning after a long trip. There is a small grocery open late literally across the street. The host is very responsive. If you are traveling with children and don't fancy staying all in one room in one of the London hotels and paying for breakfasts, this is a great option."
21832694,327691203,2018-09-24,198359796,Monique,"Wieger and I were staying at Sarah's AirBnB for an exhibition in the centre of London. We had a large truck, so we were happy we could park our van at the parking spot of the house. The neighbours were also very helpfull by assisting us. <br/><br/>The Airbnb itself was very clean and looks lovely. The beds are very comfortable and soft and we had a hard time getting out of bed since they were so comfy. <br/><br/>We would definitely recommend staying here."
21832694,329283325,2018-09-28,215846779,Rob,"We had 2 Engineers working in London for the week, the accommodation was very clean and comfortable and the location was perfect plus there was parking, a very enjoyable stay, thank you."
21832694,332408263,2018-10-05,37647070,Aleksandr,"We, a couple with a 1-year baby,  stayed at Sarah's house for a week at the end of September. We was very appreciated for all the baby stuff that we asked for! And all that presents in the fridge, that was very nice in the morning for us! Great location! close to Bus stations, Undergraund and Train! Nice playgraund for the baby in 5 minute walk, lots of Supermarkets and the Corner-shop in front of the House! Thank Sarah for quick answers, good mood and clean and very comfortable house with all the stuff we ever needed)))"
21832694,334067976,2018-10-08,90678633,Theodore,"Don’t have second thoughts, spending a weekend (or longer) in London ? Then this is the place to stay. <br/>Central, close to tube/buses, great value for money, clean, hot tub in the garden, amazingly comfortable beds, friendly welcome, helpful tips and great communication with the hosts.<br/>I don’t really see what else you can need.<br/>I couldn’t recommend a better place in London. <br/>Thank you Sarah and Alex!"

Highly recommended... although don’t want to recommend that highly as would like this place to be available for when I want to book again :)"
21832694,358179671,2018-12-13,142657582,Eshine,"Good location, near to the tube and bus station."
21832694,360338666,2018-12-20,14615004,Corina,"This place had great location and very responsive host. The place looks like someone lives there and they just left for the weekend. Not what we expected. One bedroom had a really bad bed and we could not sleep. The hot water did not work in the sink, and the towels were in bad shape and smelled like they were not washed. Bed linens seemed old and not well kept. Front door was impossible to open. It took us a good few minutes each day to try to get it open. Very dissatisfied with the experience. However, it has a very good location."
21832694,362822517,2018-12-27,279243,Keau,"We had a lovely time over Christmas at Sarah's home. She met us and showed us around the flat, which was so great. The heated floors in the kitchen were such a treat, since December in London can be quite chilly. We slept very well in the comfortable beds and the area was very quiet at night. The location is great for exploring London and feels out of the way from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet you are so close to everything! It was perfect. Thank you Sarah!"
21832694,366820859,2019-01-03,5477602,Cara,Great home and Sarah and Alex are wonderful hosts.

21832694,369096741,2019-01-09,597883,Jody,Sarah works hard to ensure her guests enjoy London.  The house is in a convenient area to public transportation hubs & many of London’s iconic sites.

We would not hesitate to stay here again.  We asked at last minute to stay and communication was swift and friendly.  Thanks again Sarah.
21832694,414295667,2019-02-19,152111090,Hassan,"Amazing place! Very spacious great location! The jacuzzi was hot and ready. <br/><br/>Overall very high end amenities, literally you can walk in and just feel right at home. It’s very warm and cozy, also has heated floors in the kitchen which was a nice little touch. <br/><br/>Plenty of towels. Sarah and Alex was very responsive whenever you reach out. They even had a bottle wine waiting for me after my long flight in. <br/><br/>I would deff recommend staying!"

It is really close to the tube stop and makes navigating London very easy. Quiet, safe neighborhood that was great for our family and walking to and from the tube stop. As well as onsite parking and friendly, helpful neighbors. We cannot say enough about Sarah and our experience at her place!"

21832694,450045983,2019-05-08,5405615,Brianna,Loved staying at this house! It was a good location because it wasn't in the middle of the craziness of the city but still close enough to transportation to get there quickly.  Also had two convenient stores within a minute walking distance. The house was clean and just a cute little place to hangout when we needed a break from all of our exploring.  We loved the little backyard area and Jacuzzi as well. Sarah was an amazing host who was quick with her responses and very helpful if we had any questions!!
21832694,456287340,2019-05-21,107044939,Taylor,Sarah is quick with communication! Her place offers a good amount of space and comfort. She even provided some extra touches to make the trip special.

She was very proactive in reaching out to us, flexible in accommodating our unexpected early arrival which was very convenient and considerate since we were traveling with small kids. The apartment was great and very conveniently located within range of two underground stations and several bus stops as well as walking distance to some of the main sights in central London. We very much recommend her place. Thank you for letting us stay. Best, Florian and Xiaoxin"

It felt instantly like home - our kids felt relaxed right off and looked forward to getting back 'home' every night. The jacuzzi was a great addition which we made use of. Sarah even left a complimentary bote of wine and many other touches, e.g. food and other amenities, which made it feel like home immediately. The area is a genuine community reflective of London's diversity yet just a short hop from some great eateries, markets and sights. We highly recommend it for families of 4 like us. We were welcomed and checked in by Carl, Sarah communicated with us throughout and Alex helped us with the checkout. Excellent service and clear communication throughout!"

21832694,483351123,2019-07-07,24774702,Abigail,Lovely house in a fabulous location. <br/>Only reason I’ve not given a 5 star is that the hot tub was not working and we where not made aware of this until we arrived.<br/>I understand these things do happen but we where a little disappointed as this was the main reason for choosing the house. <br/>Hosts where helpful and quick to reply.
21832694,488708045,2019-07-15,156840620,Alison,This is a very conveniently located house- very comfortable and beautifully appointed. It was perfect size wise for us- 2 adults and 1 ten year old child.  Sarah and Alex are very helpful and responsive- lots of great tips!

21832694,498162716,2019-07-29,248545716,Lawrence,"Very clean. Centrally located. A 5 minute walk to the subway line, busses, cool restaurants, and shops. My family and I could not have asked for more attentive and receptive hosts. The jacuzzi was very nice. The street was quiet and we felt safe walking around at all hours.

21832694,535885081,2019-09-25,40429432,Anne,A comfortable two bedroom place close to the Tube with all the promised amenities. The glass doors that open out to the yard are great and there is a dining table on the patio. There is no dining room nor eating space in the kitchen so you need to be comfortable eating on the coffee table which we were. Sarah was  very responsive and quick to address any problems.

Kitchen has all the ammenities and the house is clean and spacious, with an eye for details....we will be back"

The pictures are accurate, the check in process was easy, the house gets warm super fast - a blessing on a cold winter's night, it's stylish yet petite.

21832694,592529552,2020-01-13,4475149,Brandi,"Sarah's place was great! A 5 minute walk from the Elephant & Castle underground station, and close to a ton of buses, plus it's only about half an hour or less walk to quite a few of the sights you'll want to check out while visiting London (Big Ben, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, etc.). There are some lovely pubs and restaurants within short walking distance, and a large grocery store close by too. We loved having plenty of space and, even better, a hot tub! It was a great way to relax after long days of walking and sightseeing."

21832694,605725992,2020-02-15,1961609,Marcela,"If you are looking for a home away from home in London, Sarah’s place might just be it. The photos don’t do this beautiful space any justice. The second we opened the door we were so pleased to have booked it. The kitchen is beautiful and has everything you might need if you feel like cooking and the whole space is just cozy and comfortable. The location is extremely convenient, walking around the neighborhood you can’t help but fall in love. My husband found his commute to work to Victoria very easy from this location as buses and the tube are easily accessible. Sarah and Alex’s responsiveness was outstanding, they answered all our questions in a friendly and efficient manner. I am really glad to have a chance to review our experience with them. We were sad to leave and will definitely book this home again."

21832694,638963783,2020-07-17,214816114,Thakrim,"This place was super comfortable and homely. Myself and my partner loved every bit of the house! The hot tub was an absolute bonus and it was ever so relaxing, it’s within a gazebo which is great as it gives you some privacy unlike many other places.

Their place was just perfect for our 8 day stay, with two comfortable bedrooms, a cosy living area & a great kitchen to cook in. The garden sit out was a delightful addition to the space & the hot tub of course the icing on the cake!<br/><br/>Communication was excellent & it felt as though we were interacting with caring friends. Thank you so much!"
21832694,706112366,2020-11-02,19922137,H,"Beautiful home, very cosy and warm with great added extras such as the hot tub and private parking. Had everything we needed really was a home from home. Location is also perfect - 2 minute walk from the bus stop/ tube station into central London and beyond. Personally we though preferred to walk - it took around 25 minutes to walk to the London eye/ Thames. The perfect base for exploring London and we can’t wait to book again in the future!"
21832694,708130434,2020-11-11,2779931,Leo,Sarah’s place is a beautiful townhouse in a quiet neighbourhood close to all the action. Nearly all the touristic sights are walkable or cycle and the house is beautiful with lots of life and a very nice hot tub set up.

21832694,753278498,2021-04-30,181515069,Howard,"Lovely house, very clean and exactly how the pictures show. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that it wasn't obvious how to get outside into the garden (which was a very big deal during quarantine),  and it took more than a day of back and forth with the host to work out where the key for this was."
21832694,765867420,2021-06-03,2807218,John,"Perfect semi-detached oasis in a quiet and central neighborhood. cute and spacious for London. The garden and hot tub are the jewels in the crown.

This property is very well located around the corner from the Imperial War museum and Elephant & Castle.

21832694,438209218090583218,2021-08-27,94336230,Ian,"Great location, clean and tidy house with everything you need, although note that there are no table/chairs to sit down and eat a meal from!. off street free parking a big plus.Close to the underground network(just over 5 mins walk) and an easy walk to the South Bank/Westminster/London eye area(25 easy mins). Great communication and easy check in. Check in advance if the hot tub is working, as it wasn't on our visit which was the only downside of our stay. Would I stay again..??.. yes."

The DLR station is close by, as is a Tesco. There is a great pub 20 yards from the entrance. Quiet on Saturday night, but it was very lively<br/>on Friday night when we were there. Good music, reasonable wine and tasty food. We've not stayed in this area before, but Canary Wharf is nearby, and Greenwich is a short journey on the DLR. We had a wonderful time and I would highly recommend staying at this apartment"

21945480,328421636,2018-09-26,25139102,Giselle,Great view and location. A bit noisy at times due to the bar located outside but mostly quiet. Conveniently located by a Tesco and a rail to the subway. No issues and the owners were helpful.
21945480,330895382,2018-10-01,170752193,Ellen,"Poppy's place in Isle of Dogs / Canary Wharf was a great place to stay. The neighborhood was very nice and so beautiful right on the water. The building was secure and there was an elevator to get us to the 4th floor. Our enclosed balcony had very large windows that we could open to get fresh air in each morning / afternoon. A cozy place to sit with a cup of coffee and breakfast each morning. The host-maker team was very responsive, knowledgeable, and friendly. WiFi was fast. Kitchen was fully equipped with what we needed. Everything very clean. The DLR and a small grocery store is literally a 4 minute walk from Poppy's place. There is a pub directly across the cobblestone walking street (no cars allowed) with GREAT fish and chips. It was so good we ate there 2 evenings in a row. We were at Poppy's over a weekend so on  Friday and Saturday nights it was a bit loud with the pub so close but it didn't prevent me from sleeping. The bed was very comfortable and the room had plenty of space for luggage and drawers for putting away clothing if you're staying for a while. Plenty of beautiful large thick white towels. Very hot water and water pressure was very good. We did 1 load of laundry and it was a very efficient machine. A wonderful welcoming touch was the little care package that was left for us - delicious scones, jams, teas, and even milk in the fridge! I would definitely recommend Poppy's place and I would certainly stay here again the next time I'm in London."
21945480,348574565,2018-11-14,125332259,Inaya,"Good views and in a peaceful part of Canary Wharf.<br/><br/>Building itself is old and needs a bit of a remodel, but flat is fine but more cramped  than expected."
21945480,351563616,2018-11-23,44821449,Chris,well-appointed and in a great location for local work and travel
21945480,353053239,2018-11-26,30424778,Nati,"Apartment is located in a nice business district with a great Indian restaurant walking distance. Place was clean, but from the pictures we expected it to be newer than it really was."
21945480,355238202,2018-12-03,189426522,Duncan,Amazing place! Easy to get to and nice and quiet when you’re finished from a busy day in the city. Amazing view of the harbor and city at night. Felt like a home away from home and we hopefully plan on staying again sometime in the future. I would recommend this place 100%!
21945480,358418193,2018-12-14,43412373,Harjinder,"Really nice flat, well located and spacious"
21945480,401857256,2019-01-16,86400093,Christopher,"The place is as expected for the price. Steps from the DLR train that can connect you to Canary Wharf station. There is also a Tesco express, breakfast spot, Papa Johns, Indian Restaurant, and other shops within a 5 minute walk of the apartment. A pub is directly across from the apartment as well! About an hour train ride out of Terminal 4 from LHR Airport and 35 minutes from Piccadilly Circus Station. The place is perfect for 2-3 people and has nice views of the water from the Window. It was perfect for  a 5 day stay. Be sure to lay a towel on the bathroom floor as water gets everywhere from the shower. What we were not pleased with was apparent new owners of the apartment building coming for an inspection. Could that have been scheduled for a time when guests were not staying? Luckily our request to have them come after we left was considered and it wasn't an issue."
21945480,403113394,2019-01-20,150739785,Elliot,"Loved our stay, flat is quirky, clean and right next to the dlr so easy to get around. Tesco is nearby too!"

Her home was exactly what we were looking for when coming to London to run the Hackney Half. The location is great and her home is just beautiful. We felt so comfortable straight away and she makes every effort to make you feel this way with lovely personal touches! She even left energy bars out to help us on our way with the race which was a lovely touch! Thank you so much, we will definitely come to stay again if we are in the area! x"

We found it very well-laid out and  nicely decorated. Plus, she left us plenty of staples to keep us going until we had a chance to get to the shops.I highly recommend Charlotte's place for your visit to Hackney. The street is surprisingly quiet and yet you aren't far from shops for all you need"

22256511,226757322,2018-01-12,23944930,Anastasia,"Perfect modern stylish place, very welcoming and thoughtful hostess. The place is super comfortable, can easily host from a whole family to a couple. The building is new, so all the facilities inside the flat are contemporary, and easy to handle. Comfortable bedroom and separate spacious living room. Love the city view from the balcony! A bonus is Dalston itself as an area: it's young, hip, full of cool restaurants, cafes, galleries. A very vibrant lively side of London. Would book here again!"
22256511,232232814,2018-02-04,50820879,James,The flat has the most spectacular skyline view towards the city of London. Worth staying just for this.

It was peaceful, clean and comfortable and having your own ensuite bathroom was amazing. I didnt use the kitchen aprt from to make coffee but its use was offered to me upon arrival. It has everything you need if you wanted to cook and has lots of fridge storage. The house is in a very quiet location and there are eateries and shops just around the corner. You could also get the nightbus from central London to plumstead if you needed to.  I didnt meet Melvin as we were both busy but i did meet his son a few times who was nothing but pleasant. Thanks Again Melvin, il defo see if you have any rooms going next time time i need."

22258923,276254048,2018-06-13,168443277,James,"First time i used Airbnb, from start to finish Melvin offered the best possible hospitality and made my experience great. Such a kind, genuine bloke who I could have a laugh and great conversation with. The house is just 1 min walk away from the high street with many bus routes too surrounding areas such as Woolwich where you can catch the dlr into London. In walking distance of the railway station also which has trains very frequently. The house itself was as described, nice spacious room and the kitchen area was too, where I could cook my meals no problem. Also the house is extremely quiet! Which was a massive plus when I came home from a long day. If you want affordable accommodation, with very good transport links to central London and many local shops. This is the one for you. Thanks for having me Melvin until next time I’ll keep in touch mate "
22258923,278628352,2018-06-18,4744888,Roberto,"Melvin è gentilissimo, la camera accogliente e pulita. La stazione ferroviaria più vicina è Plumstead ed è raggiungibile in 15 minuti a piedi oppure con il bus.<br/>Esperienza positiva e consigliata."
22258923,281151442,2018-06-24,126399795,Karolina,"Melvin and his place were great. He was a very helpful and caring host. Even though the house is a bit far to the central London, the commute is really nice and easy. The bed was a bit uncomfortable, as you could feel each spring. Also there was a stain on the carpet. Besides that, the room and the whole apartment was squeaky clean. TV in the bedroom was a nice touch. "
22258923,282444932,2018-06-27,75063014,Manon,"Melvin is very nice, welcoming and attentive. The bedroom and the bathroom were clean and like the pictures, but careful there is not jacuzzi! <br/><br/>"

22258923,300904832,2018-08-03,66776736,Paul,"Melvin is really welcoming and does everything to make your stay perfect. It was 10 minutes walk to the station and the overground takes you straight to central London. The room was a double with an en suite. It was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The street Melvin lives on is very quiet and the local amenities are very close. I would recommend staying with Melvin either for business or pleasure ,he is a great host."
22258923,307451785,2018-08-14,192836797,Monika,"Melvin is a great host and one of the kindest people we've ever met. He made sure that we had everything we needed and even though he was not home very often, because of his work, he always helped us and we spent some precious time with him. He's a very polite and humble person. We looked for a typical english house, so if you're looking for it as well, you will love this house. We had no problems with anything. A literal home away from home. We definitely recommend!"

I'd definitely recommend this place - and Melvin as a wonderful host."

22258923,367670498,2019-01-05,112511919,An,"One of the best hosts I’ve ever had on Airbnb. Melvin is really helpful, cares about his guests not only about arrival time, check-out etc. but also about the staying, travel methods, local tips. Especially, he gave me brilliant tip for the best chips shop in the neighborhood and it has been so far one of the best chips shop I’ve tried within Europe. The house is lovely, clean, close to the bus stops and literally it has everything you need. The neighborhood is quite nice with a nearby park, church and once again, a wonderful chips shop called Grizzlys Burger!! <br/>Great idea for those who dont wanna live to close to the center and willing to explore other parts of London!"
22258923,409265528,2019-02-07,229109184,Robin,My accommodations were exactly as posted. Melvin’s home is warm and comfortable and he was an attentive host.

He provided excellent value for money and his place was very suitable for this purpose, with full access to the kitchen, shops very nearby and a much larger shopping area (Woolwich Arsenal) just a short bus ride (or 20 - 25 minute walk) away."

Einfaches Stadtviertel mit vielen kleinen Supermärkten und Imbissen / Restaurants. Melvin und Myah haben auf Emails immer zuverlässig reagiert und sich gut um uns gekümmert.<br/>Wie für so viele Doppelzimmer in England gilt auch hier: Eine gemeinsame Bettdecke; wer damit ein Problem hat sollte ggf. einen Schlafsack einpacken."

Le logement se trouve à 10 à 15 minutes à pieds de la station Plumstead. Je recommande vivement cette location. Plutôt compliquée et pointilleuse, j’ai du mal à me sentir à l’aise dans les AIRBNB en général, et pourtant cette fois, ça a été le cas."

Melvin really thinks about how he can make his guest feel most at ease and accommodates in the best way that he can. I would only recommend keeping bedding and use of iron in common areas for ease of access as and when needed. Would stay here again. Great Airbnb experience in London! Thanks, Melvin"

The room is bright and spacious, with everything you need to have a comfortable stay. Melvin is friendly and welcoming, with a lot of helpful advice about London.

22335762,230891499,2018-01-29,18011468,Jack,"Raf's brand new penthouse apartment is true penthouse luxury combined with stunning design and an amazing attention to the details. Most new builds are tight on space especially in the bedrooms but this penthouse is extremely spacious. The master bedroom is very large with an ensuite and a large kingsize bed. The other two bedrooms are also spacious with a lovely balcony and super comfy beds. The open plan sitting room, dining room and kitchen are very large and super stylish. There is also a large balcony off the sitting room. The photos truly don't do the penthouse justice. This apartment really has the wow factor to it. I was so impressed with the design and the amazing decorations. The kitchen had everything you needed including a Nespresso machine and pods. Raf even went the extra mile by providing milk, water, juice, fresh fruit and a selection of pastries. Both the bathrooms even had travel size body wash, shampoo and conditioner. As I was renting the penthouse for the family that was visiting me for my birthday. I was very surprised to find a lovely wrapped birthday gift from Raf and his family. The check in and check out was smooth and easy and I was given a full tour of the apartment by Raf and shown everything that I might need during my stay. The hosting was brilliant super quick to respond and they were so accommodating to my check-in and check out time. Raf and his wife were so kind as they were waiting for a new garage fob to arrive they even came on the second day just to let my nephew leave the underground parking lot. The only downside to my stay was it was only two days and not longer. I highly recommend Raf's amazing penthouse for your next stay. I will be back for sure on my next rental need in London. Thank you, Raf and your family, for making my birthday weekend one an amazing one."
22335762,232589616,2018-02-05,33643973,Alex,"What an apartment! OMG. This checked all our boxes and then some. It’s right in the midst of the Olympic Park and the views from both large terraces were truly SPECTACULAR! Especially the Olympic Stadium when lit up at night. The penthouse is also much larger than your average 3-bed apartment, which was a nice bonus. Everything was top notch designer stuff and the whole place was totally spotless. Checkin and checkout was a breeze and Raf and his partner were so helpful and always quick to respond throughout our stay. I can also imagine this place being ideal for families as there is so much to do right outside your doorstep: Bike rental, playground, BMX tracks, mountain biking trails, and of course all the Olympic Park’s other famous amenities. We discovered this really cool place on the canal, The Breakfast Club, a short 5min walk away. It’s so chilled! There is just so much to do and too little time. We would highly recommend Raf’s penthouse. Definitely coming back. 5/5 stars!"

My previous review sums it all up so won’t repeat myself. Just a few things to mention. The penthouse is both extremely spacious and super stylish. The hosting is impeccable and the additional touches of things like breakfast pastries and travel toiletries being provided really stand out. The penthouse is also immaculately clean which is so lovely. Thanks again Raf and Nicky for another amazing stay. We look forward to seeing you soon on my next London rental.

It was perfect for the 6 of us and we enjoyed the home away from home feel of the flat.<br/><br/>Hosts were great as well .... easy to communicate and smooth checking in and out. Raf and Nicky were always there if you needed them.<br/><br/>Best thing is... shoes have to be taken off at the foyer to make sure that the flat is clean! I absolutely love that as I tend to take my shoes off at other AirBnBs. The flat was spotless when we checked in.<br/><br/>Location wise ... its a walking distance to a Sainsbury’s Local towards the back of the building... about 5-10mins walk.  Westfield Stratford Shopping Centre and Stratford station (tube/ rail) are also nearby. West Ham London Stadium is just a stone’s throw away also. Olympic Park is just across the road... and the Olympic Rings are visible from the balcony.<br/><br/>All in all... a very nice stay. Thanks Raf and Nicky! Merry x’mas!

22335762,612806412,2020-03-01,32904022,Manvendra Singh,"We had absolutely the most spectacular stay-cation in London and at the heart of it was place we were in. Raf’s apartment is stunningly beautiful and speaks volumes on his sense of aesthetic, but more importantly, his attention for detail in curation and consideration for guest needs and comfort. The air bed in the master bedroom is stunning and living room is just perfect to laze around all day. He allowed us an early check in, a late check out, helped us with everything we needed or could need and was hospitable in ever sense of the word. <br/><br/>Being in the hotel business myself, I know what it takes to keep such standards and consistency. We highly recommend Rafs place and wish that he opens many more around the world."
22335762,621426169,2020-03-31,320751939,Anj,"It is everything that it says and more!!! Aside from the beautiful apartment, the best thing that made the huge difference for me about this experience with AirBnb are  the hosts themselves, Nicky & Raf — they both went out of their way to make me feel welcomed especially when I got stuck in London because of the pandemic  Thank you and may you both continue to be a blessing to others "

We chose to do our quarantine at the flat and it was the best choice. Very spacious, beautiful views, wonderful balconies, and very clean are just a few of the many perks. Raf really takes attention to detail seriously and there was nothing missing that we needed to have a comfortable stay. The air conditioner worked for the hotter days while the breeze was perfect on cool days. The kitchen was fully equipped, along with some toys for our lil one, and weights, and a bottle of wine and staples like milk and coffee. It truly was a home away from home, we have never experienced the Olympic park area before and absolutely loved the peaceful vibe and proximity to cafes, and the mall.<br/><br/>Thanks again Raf!"

La posizione era ottima per i miei scopi e la fermata dell'autobus si trova a 1 minuto a piedi. Fortemente consigliato."
22389057,231679075,2018-02-02,163677839,Ruben,"The room and the house are super nice and clean. Everything is new.<br/><br/>Very good value for money.<br/><br/>The location was also quite good.<br/><br/>And, by the way, I slept quite well.<br/><br/>Thank you"
22389057,232263574,2018-02-04,71651665,Ngọc,Ashkan home was great to us. Dining room and kitchen were very clean and tiny.<br/><br/>Please using bus to travel form central to this place and vice versa. 24hours bus stop just right in front of the house.
22389057,234331282,2018-02-12,161674194,Tatiana,"The house, the ubicación and everything else was perfect. Our stay at this home was perfect and we will surely repeat.<br/>Ashkan is always available to make our stay fantastic. <br/><br/>All the furniture and the whole house are perfect and new, as shown in the photographs.<br/><br/>Perfect house with a perfect price, 10/10."
22389057,235306959,2018-02-16,103243516,Alessandro,L'alloggio è lontano dal centro circa 40 minuti di bus. Il proprietario mi ha fornito indicazioni poco precise e la casa ha fornito pochi servizi di igiene e di confort
22389057,240568244,2018-03-05,86513149,Perigaud,"Pas trop mal desservi ou niveau des bus il passe dans la rue quasiment devant la maison... en revanche il faudra marcher au moins 15min pour aller à la station de métro la plus proche. <br/>L’endroit et l’accueil vraiment sympathique,FARIBA est adorable est très attentionnée,la télé ne fonctionnait plus le matin le soir même elle avait été remplacée... très réactif au niveau communication!Endroit très propre et calme vous y passerez un séjour vraiment très bien et avec la neige si il y en a ce sera encore plus magique!<br/>Merci pour ce séjour!!!! Hâte de revenir"
22389057,243523626,2018-03-16,40754814,Alessandro,"Very nice and clean apartment. A bit out of the center but well connected via bus day and night. In London it's difficult to find these prices in such nice places! We did not have the pleasure to meet Ashlan in person but he was very quick and polite in our emails in order to clear any of our doubts, anyways we met Fariba and she was very helpful :) thank you both!"
22389057,247148144,2018-03-27,41532306,Marina,"Hemos estado genial en la casa de Ashkan.<br/>Su madre y su padre nos recibieron para hacer el check in y a pesar de que llegábamos muy pronto fueron muy flexibles con nosotros.<br/>La habitación esta genial, limpia y cómoda con todo lo que necesitas. La cocina genial y con todos los utensilios. Hasta tenían plancha y secador por si no lo llevabas. <br/>La ubicación está bien relación calidad- precio. Tardas unos 30 minutos en autobús al centro de Londres, pero vas viendo la ciudad, así que sino tenéis prisa, os recomendamos esta opción mejor que el metro.<br/><br/>Sin lugar a dudas, muy recomendable! ¡Volveremos! ¡Gracias!"
22389057,247705496,2018-03-29,122094197,Mo & Zan,"A really good room in a lovely, clean house. Close to the bus which was a straight run into town. An excellent position and we would certainly go back."
22389057,249991393,2018-04-03,141395195,Yarda,"Hi Ashkan, thank for Your patience. Our first flight was canceled and second one 110min late. But he was waiting for us till 2:30 am. We are very greatful. House is completely new and very comfortable. I recommend it. Yarda"
22389057,251552416,2018-04-08,17153510,Bernard,"Perfect place to stay. Clean, cheap, friendly and not that far from the heart of the city"
22389057,252589338,2018-04-11,128513088,Delio,Great experience. Two day only but was exceptional!
22389057,254625844,2018-04-17,22660965,Callan,"Great value for the money! My boyfriend and I stayed here for about 3 nights and we loved it. It is a little further outside of London, about 40-45 mins by bus, but buying a day ticket for the bus only costs 5 pounds and makes this place very affordable for students or other young people. The kitchen and bathroom were very modern and were lovely additions. I would definitely recommend this place for couples and people who are staying in the city for more than a day or two!"
22389057,260048981,2018-05-03,107066933,Laura,Todo muy bien y muy correcto. Muy bien comunicado. Muy limpio

22389057,271836522,2018-06-02,92630692,Ruijia,"We stayed 3 nights. Owner is really kind and friendly. House is not so far from central and it’s really convenient about transportation like the bus station near by. House is pretty new and clean, the price is really worth for it. The only tiny thing is about outside, which is the noisy from traffic. Anyway  for this  price is not big issue."
22389057,275954761,2018-06-12,123190430,Hui,房东我们没见着，房东的妈妈很漂亮､很热情，我们都喜欢她。居住位置偏远，但交通非常方便， (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) 分钟就到市中心了。

22389057,282742604,2018-06-28,22369395,Aishath,We had a great stay at Ashkan’s place. The house is in a convenient location with bus stops right outside the house. The room was clean and comfortable. Fariba is such a lovely lady. Would definitely stay here again. :)
22389057,285339226,2018-07-03,182697197,Jessica,"Great stay. Nice host (we never met Ashkan, but Fariba) and warm welcome. Comfy bed , great shower and nice equipped Airbnb.<br/>Downside: very noisy if people stay in the apartment above you (you hear every step).<br/>But over all a very good experience and we will come back on our next trip!<br/><br/>Thanks Ashkan and Fariba!<br/>"
22389057,288709917,2018-07-10,39971271,Gaby,"We had a wonderful time at Ashkan's! Fariba was so thoughtful and communicative. Location was great, just a 1/2 minute walk to the bus stop and a supermarket at 10 minute walk. The house was beautiful and well kept. We felt very much at home and would come back again any time ❤"
22389057,291711302,2018-07-16,10550889,Christian,"Very good communication with real fast responses. we we where late at our arrival and it was already 1 AM and no problem with the check in, really appreciate it. The Kitchen and Bath are both in real new conditions and some more work in the outside is done so it will become better in the Outside too, i can recommend it"

22389057,303445022,2018-08-07,85331548,Kaeleigh,"Excellent place, close to a shopping center. Transit is very close and makes it easy to access the city center. Great host, stylish place, well worth the price!"

22389057,313983015,2018-08-26,52356891,Grisel,"Ash and his mother were BEYOND accommodating to us. On our day of travel to London we were in an unfortunate accident which delayed our check in by 5 hours. Regardless, Ash and his mother were very understanding and patient with us. On top of this, the house is spotless, amenities were great, as well as a very accessible location. Ash sent so many tips on how to get around London, and helps you find the home upon arrival. We will recommend their home to all our friends and hope to return soon! "
22389057,315192401,2018-08-28,116909172,Taiyo,Nice and cozy
22389057,322940406,2018-09-14,192825583,Therese,"Wir waren sehr zufrieden mit diesem Airbnb. Es war sauber und die Gastgeber waren sehr öffentlich. Mit dem Bus kommt man einfach in die Stadt, was wir sehr praktisch finden. Die Unterkünfte direkt in London sind sehr teuer und da ist dieses Airbnb eine gute Alternative wenn man etwas Geld sparen möchte. Kann es nur empfehlen!"
22389057,329257519,2018-09-28,89525044,Ciphy,"I really like this place, for sure will come back someday...Super clean room, kitchen, dining room, backyard, bathroom, washing machine...Mrs Fariba (Ashkan's mom) was super friendly, she help us with everything..<br/><br/>They provide hair dryer, hand soap at bathroom, towel, hanger to dry the washing clothes, fridge, detergent to wash with the washing machine.. every single pieces for personal needs, they provide..<br/><br/>Fluffy bed, pillow also available..Infront of the house, available 24hours bus (to Marble Arch & Brent Cross no.189) only 30 mins to Buckingham Palace..<br/><br/>Im happy and fully satisfied with Mrs Fariba also the place for living 7 nights at London..<br/>Thank you so much.."
22389057,334141851,2018-10-08,128790531,Mina,"Bus stop across the street so that is very convenient. Very clean place. Access to a kitchen with a supermarket within walking distance. <br/>Suggestions: bring your own towel, an extra blanket if you get cold easily, and try to get to location as quick as possible to check in time as the hostess that may greet you does not appreciate delays."
22389057,334852096,2018-10-10,79077279,Marcela,"the place is just like in the photos, the bed is super comfortable, I highly recommend it"
22389057,335482588,2018-10-12,15900956,Thomas & Karan,"We enjoyed our stay at Ashkan (30Sep - 5Oct, and 10Oct - 12 Oct), and would be returning for another stay 19Oct - 27 Oct.  Our room was clean and spacious, and we have a generous 3 door wardrobe.  Check in and out were a breeze.   Communication with Fariba was effective and friendly.   We are happy that there is a television in the room as we usually watch telly when we do our ironing.   Overall, we are very happy with what Ashkan and Fariba have provided for us.  We just hope that future travellers would be more considerate with shared space, i.e. bathrooms and kitchen.  When we were there for our first stay, the other Airbnb guests made a mess of the bathroom;  they did not clean up after they have used the kitchen too, leaving the toaster and microwave oven counter dirty, and leaving the used cutlery and crockery in the sink!"
22389057,337118382,2018-10-15,121726572,Jurg,Awesome hosts. Very nice and clean house. Highly recommended place to stay in London for such good price
22389057,342062758,2018-10-28,104467478,Marie,"Ashkan's place is exactly as described, super sparkly clean, quiet and cozy. It's very well connected by buses and within walking distance from a major shopping centre/tube station. Aside from that, we really appreciated Ash and his mum to be super friendly, very responsive and they made our self-check in at 2am possible. All in all, we definitely find this place a bargain and would recommend to anyone for a short stay in London."
22389057,348561845,2018-11-14,50993929,Samba,"Fantastic place to stay if you don't want to pay Hella to explore London, would rent again"
22389057,351293846,2018-11-22,109340739,Theodora,"Ashkan’s place is great. Very comfortable rooms, nice bathroom, and with a really great kitchen! To be honest, it’s not that close to the center but I actually liked that! Because the neighborhood was great and quiet and the transportation was fun. <br/>If you are planning to go to London, this Home is a great choice! And as a first-time-using-airbnb person I can say that my first experience was the best :)"
22389057,352547143,2018-11-25,73009927,Audrey,"Nous avons bien était accueillis cependant notre chambre se situé à l'entrée de la maison donc nous avons eut beaucoup de bruits (voiture et aller et retour des habitants), la chambre était grande et propre, la maison bien située par rapport aux commodités ! Cependant nous devions avoir une salle de bain avec baignoire et nous avons eut une salle de bain avec douche, j'ai était déçu car l'hôte nous avait affirmé que nous aurions une salle de bain, je suis un peu déçu pour le coup ! Sinon c'était bien dans l'ensemble"
22389057,354836577,2018-12-02,157457756,Bruno,"The room is well located with a bus right on the other side of the road and it has all the amenities just like if you're at your own house. The host was extremely kind and responsive, making sure that everything was ok.<br/>I will, for sure book this room again!"
22389057,355694804,2018-12-05,33954147,Vanessa,"Great host, was very helpful with directions to and from his place. Provided local tips. Flat is very clean and stylish. Host and his father, Mo,  were very hospitable and went out of their way to provide accommodations as needed. 10/10 would recommend!"
22389057,358383502,2018-12-14,212688156,Cleofe,We had a great stay in their house. They are very accommodating and helpful for everything. I definitely recommend their place.
22389057,359615656,2018-12-17,41027052,Marian,"Very great journey. Ashkan's house is really clean, everything needed was here. Can't be better. The plus was the bus and underground services 24/24h. I definitely recommend Ashkan."

22389057,401380983,2019-01-14,229321801,Andrea,"El alojamiento es tal cual se describe, muy limpio, cuenta con muchos servicios. Aunque está alejado del centro de la ciudad, desde el aeropuerto podes tomar un tren y luego un bus o caminar. Y durante la estancia, nos manejamos con bus qué pasa por la puerta y nos acercaba. En la casa, la encargada es muy servicial y está atenta a todo lo que puedas necesitar. Muy recomendable!"
22389057,408713118,2019-02-05,106866641,Algirdas,Amazing value
22389057,410052944,2019-02-09,228932532,Ivonne,It was our first Airbnb try at it was great. Everything was like at the photos. we were allowed to use the kitchen and space at fridge. It is really a maximum 35 minutes drive to the city with the Bus and the bus runs about every 5-7 minutes. A nice shopping centre is only three bus stops away. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Before arrive we get many detailled informations from Ashkan. Fariba welcomes us at our first day. she is a really nice and lovely person.  Everything is well organized. <br/><br/>I think you can't find a better place to stay in London for that money
22389057,411725656,2019-02-13,230310620,Yannik,A clean and modern room with an open family who kindly share their kitchen and bath with you. The room can be locked and you get an own key for the main door. The walls are a bit thin so you can sometimes hear people walking above or beside your room.
22389057,414989333,2019-02-21,68527390,Camille,Lovely place !!! just a bit noisy when someone is in the room above you. Great stay
22389057,416871680,2019-02-25,231665071,Jabir M,Outstanding!
22389057,417761921,2019-02-28,16122964,Derman,"Ashkan's home was the perfect choice for our stay. The house is spacious, super clean, modern and very well equipped. Communication was great and everything was just as described. Bus stop right in front of the house and subway around 10 minutes by walk. A very nice neighbourhood! Definitely recommended"
22389057,424240876,2019-03-16,78954234,Piper,The place is extremely clean and easy to navigate. Ashkan made check-in extremely simple and was easily reached for questions or help. The location was absurdly convenient as there is a bus stop literally right outside that can take you nearly anywhere you want to go. We even had to stay in for a day due to weather and had no issues with the accommodations as there was a TV and it was easily accessible for food delivery services :) We would highly recommend staying here for anyone visiting London!
22389057,426553960,2019-03-21,226670655,Gaetano,"Bel posto, non al centro ma ben collegato con i bus (35/40 minuti con traffico moderato). La zona é molto tranquilla così come l'appartamento. L'arredamento é ricercato e non manca di nulla, così come la cucina ed il bagno."
22389057,429268120,2019-03-27,91582192,Alexander,"Ashkan was very hospitable pre arrival to the location and the directions he gave, made it super easy to travel to the city. The room was very clean and professional, would definitely recommend for future travellers!"
22389057,432277134,2019-04-03,238694742,Ginette,"Appartement très propre, fonctionnel avec accès à la cuisine et la salle à manger.<br/>Par contre notre chambre près de la porte d'entrée et donnant sur la rue était bruyante à cause des allées et venues des autres locataires et de la circulation assez intense de la rue."
22389057,433304772,2019-04-06,245729719,Kajsa,Rent och bekvämt ställe att övernatta på. Bättre än vad jag har förväntat !
22389057,435383116,2019-04-10,87968663,Alejandro,"La casa impecable, su padre excepcional en cuanto a hospitalidad. La habitación ideal para una pareja, todo limpio y moderno. Aunque la casa queda lejos del centro hay buenas vías de comunicación. Repetiriamos sin duda"
22389057,444678497,2019-04-28,211504941,Margarita,"Alojamiento increíble, muy amables y se amoldaron en todo momento a nuestra llegada. Lo único que pilla un poco retirado del centro, pero se compensa con el buen transporte."
22389057,446443166,2019-05-01,69897978,Warren,"Askhan and Mari were very warm and friendly! They provided directions and many local travelling tips prior to our arrival! Room was spacious and clean, the shared toilet and kitchen was well maintained and  had pretty much everything you need! The house was located by the road which was literally outside the bustop and quite accessible to the city in 15-30mins depending on traffic"
22389057,452495202,2019-05-13,204825829,Víctor,Great place. Would come back without hesitating

22389057,465828876,2019-06-08,172703421,Rose,"Great place! The host was very informative and kind. Personally we found the easiest way into the city center was the tube, only about a mile from the apt. Easy to navigate and the room was comfy. Will definitely consider staying again!"
22389057,488596517,2019-07-15,264870647,Ka Han,The room is very clean.
22389057,490318528,2019-07-18,268125497,Annika Storm,All in all Ashkan‘s place is okay to stay in. The bedroom looked like the pictures but some parts probably need to be fixed like the curtain racks because it fell out of the wall. The shared bathroom was beautiful but wasn’t cleaned in 4 days.
22389057,499453878,2019-07-31,264264875,Julia,Thank you for the great stay at your accommodation.<br/>We really appreciated the privacy that we had and everything was so modern and clean.<br/>We felt very comfortable and safe during our visit.<br/>If we get the chance we will definitely come back.
22389057,503558364,2019-08-06,268359490,Olivia,"This place didn’t match the pictures or the reviews. The location was ok, but definitely more than a half hour from the city. The bedrooms were located on the ground floor with a small curtain that barely covered the windows. The windows face a busy street and I didn’t feel super safe."
22389057,517255596,2019-08-25,89548625,Ji,"Not as close from the city as the owner has stated. Was unresponsive to my messages. Walls were extremely thin, however the room and bathroom was clean. Had 3 buses around the area."
22389057,519294453,2019-08-28,85248329,Linh,The accommodation is new and perfectly clean. The kitchen has a full range of essential equipments and a lovely garden view. Our keys were stolen and we came home at midnight but we could still contact the host to open the door. She did not even charge extra fee for the new keys. Thank you so much for hosting us!

22389057,616257740,2020-03-09,269025090,Marit,"Hele fijne locatie om te verblijven! Een aantal weken voor de aankomst wordt er heel veel informatie toegestuurd over de locatie en omstreken. <br/>Hele schone en frisse kamer, wij hadden een gedeelde badkamer, maar door de goede afspraken was dit prima te doen. Het enige nadeel is dat het huis nogal gehorig is, dus wij hoorde alles bij de buren. We kregen de instructie om op de dag van aankomst te laten weten hoelaat we geland waren en aan zouden komen. Helaas is hier niet op gereageerd, waardoor we niet wisten of het bericht duidelijk was aangekomen. Misschien een punt van verbetering. <br/>Desalniettemin was het een prima locatie en zouden wij zeker terug gaan."

Loads of other small shops nearby and portobello road and notting Hill is a short walk away. Bus stop right outside the door with good links into central London too. Nathalie’s home was filled with character and it was very cozy indeed! Thank you for a great stay. "
22779149,266676058,2018-05-20,179809620,Jonny,Nathalie's home was a great choice for our visit to London and is highly recommended. The Flat is exactly as described and is ideally situated in central Notting Hill with excellent across to all parts of central London. Nathalie and the support team provided excellent communication prior to our arrival and throughout our stay and made our first airbnb experience a great one!

22779149,551378288,2019-10-20,32441278,Philip,"Loved this neighborhood and apartment. Very cute and artsy, and so close to the fun Portobello Rd in Notting hill. Spacious and comfy. I do have a few small complaints. My biggest is the check-in, which involves walking a couple streets away to pick-up the key. If you have baggage or there is weather, this is an inconvenience that feels unnecessary. I'd also say that the shower and bed are not the best. Not bad at all, just not the most comfortable. Still, a very nice place, worth the price, and would recommend."
22779149,565163586,2019-11-17,8829597,Paloma,"Nice apartment a few minutes from Portobello road.<br/>It was cosy and nice thanks to the very effective heating system.<br/>However there were two things we didn't like:<br/>The bed is described as a queen bed, however it's a double (we measured it) so that wasn't such a good surprise.<br/>The windows are very thin and badly isolated so the cold air comes in (especially in the bedroom). Luckily the heaters are very powerful so we could sleep anyway.<br/>Overall a good experience in a very nice part of London."
22779149,571680039,2019-12-01,63916066,Giulia,"L’host è gentilissima e la casa molto carina, ma è affidata a un’agenzia che gestisce appartamenti e che ci ha creato vari problemi al check in. La manutenzione potrebbe essere più attenta (lampadine, prese, regolazione termostato). Inoltre, un eccesso di messaggi chiaramente automatici da parte dell’agenzia, molto fastidiosi."
22779149,573854466,2019-12-07,34326994,Jorica,"Natalie’s place was well located close to the tube which was convenient for exploring the city. It was very clean and stylish we enjoyed our stay greatly. Her support team was attentive and quick to respond. We would definitely recommend.  The only thing we wished was different was to have the lockbox closer to the apartment, after a long travel day it was a bit arduous to figure out as it wasn’t a check in process we’ve encountered before - but that was minor compared to how lovely the place is."

When we arrived, we were very disappointed with the outside of the property, since the reality was not as depicted in the photos. The whole area is in need of a cleanup. The actual living space was fine and looked like the photos. London was extremely warm while we were there. There was no air conditioning, which we knew ahead of our visit, so we had to open the windows. Since the house sits on a very busy road, the traffic noise was quite high. It was very common for police cars and ambulances to speed by with sirens blaring. Due to the high temperatures, sleeping was difficult. Fans would have been welcomed but there were none. I can imagine that we would have enjoyed our visit much more in a time of cooler temperatures. "
22903218,294678869,2018-07-22,5726688,Peter,"Nice clean and stylish house in south London. Good access to transportation - about a 10 minute walk to the nearest tube station, but with a bus stop right outside with frequent buses to Vauxhall or Victoria. Nice small co-op supermarket just a few minutes walk away, and we enjoyed the local Indian restaurant, fish and chip shop and pub."

The inside space is good with nice furnishings and the bedrooms are very spacious. We found the living and kitchen areas on the small side for our family of 4 and it was very hard to find anywhere nearby to park our car. Everywhere is permit holders only or pay for max 4 hours stay. The outside areas need tidying up, particularly the front of the property but if you can look past that the place is good. It is on a busy road but we didn’t find the noise inside to be bad and the small garden at the back is also surprisingly peaceful. Chloe was helpful and responsive to most of our queries."
22998262,326453928,2018-09-22,25982154,Sasha,"The apartment was great. I came for a business trip for a week and felt as at home. Very spacious an comfortable, in a beautiful and safe area. Wide and tall windows, a balcony along the whole apartment made it super special esp. in the mornings. Francesco explained everything in deep details, so I had no questions during the week to bother him."

23127458,483348880,2019-07-07,13156872,Sarah,Tati is a gracious and extra special host who did everything to make our stay comfortable and easy.  Her two children are smart and fun to be with too.  We really enjoyed talking with them all.  The neighborhood is fantastic with lots of shops and restaurants close by.  We were attending Wimbledon which is an easy bus ride away.  It helped us to avoid the crowds on the train.  The bed was really comfortable and I slept well.  She also offered us a delicious breakfast each morning.  We couldn't have asked for more.

Can't wait to stay here again, especially in the summer to be able to use that lovely terrace.<br/>Perfect host A***** :)"
23227018,238241336,2018-02-25,15874918,Ash,"We weren’t the best of guests during our stay. Helen had to wait for us for quite sometime during both check in and check out but at both times she was very patient which allowed us to reach the house and leave the house without being panic. The house is very clean and very near to a bus stop. And we really like the decor, and the different colour combinations in all the rooms."

23227018,246355008,2018-03-25,176531287,Ben,What a fantastic place to stay! Was perfect for what we needed for our london stay. Only a 5 minute walk to the train station and a 10 minute walk from main amenities/nightlife. Complete home away from home. Helen is a fanastic host and was in constant communication for anything we needed. If we could give her 50 stars we would!
23227018,248895755,2018-04-01,39993779,Isabel,"Aunque no conocimos a Hellen personalmente, estuvimos en contacto constante, nos dejó todo preparado perfectamente y nos encantó el detalle de dejarnos cositas para el desayuno, cosa que agradecimos porque viajamos con tres niños pequeños, llegamos ya tarde y llovía un montón. El apartamento limpio y calentito. El sofá cama un poco incómodo....sin embargo, en general 100% recomendable!"
23227018,250494228,2018-04-05,10048055,Liz,"Helen is the best host somebody could wish for. She is very welcoming and kind and provided us with everything needed! The house is well located in a quiet neighbourhood near Regents Canal. We would recommend to stroll down the Canal towards Broadway Road and have breakfast or dinner there. Our breakfast favourite definitely  was ""El Ganso"". It felt so nice to feel at home in bustling London!"
23227018,250856227,2018-04-06,45094485,Ross,"Helen’s place is AWESOME. I stay in Airbnb’s every week in London for work, this was by far the nicest and most fun + interesting! Helen super helpful and flexible too."
23227018,251592897,2018-04-08,8004379,Rachel,"I rented Helen's flat for a get together of about 15 people during the day, and then 4 us stayed over. The flat was great for this purpose and Helen was extremely accommodating, particularly when it came to check in and check out times. I would definitely recommend this flat for a similar purpose or just as somewhere for a few people to stay in London. On the lead up to our stay Helen was very quick to respond to any questions I had, which was reassuring! I would definitely stay in this flat again."
23227018,253414714,2018-04-14,32475249,Anne,Contents d’avoir pu séjourner dans ce logement!Nous  Étions 4 dont 2 enfants.

23227018,253905753,2018-04-15,9893631,Isabelle,"Stayed here after my 30th birthday with some friends as live further out in London. Absolute cracking place - pictures don’t do it justice! Helen was a great host, super accommodating! Recommend for a reasonably priced London stay in one of my favourite areas!"
23227018,254842806,2018-04-18,12374648,Marc,"Helen's place is super cosy and creatively decorated, quietly situated in a very typical London borough, I'd say. Communication was fast and precise, everything well prepared and the balcony inviting to relax. Took me only 5 min to reach the Overground station Haggerston, connecting me to all my London destinations. Since I was on a business trip it would nice to stay longer once and discover the neighbourhood a bit more intensively. Thanks, Helen!"
23227018,256106606,2018-04-22,176433706,Gema,"Lugar acogedor y limpio en un barrio tranquilo, pero hacía mucho calor en la casa. Más cómodo para 4 personas que para 5.<br/>La casera muy atenta."

Helen was the perfect host, we felt very welcome.<br/><br/>The house was immaculately clean, and is situated extremely close to the overground station. There are plenty of shops in walking distance and the area is lovely and quiet. <br/><br/>The top bedroom is lovely and light, and the bathroom is spacious. Unfortunately we arrived in the rain, the welcome addition of board games, lots of books and a piano definitely brightened our day. We appreciated the piano, although we definitely need to brush up on our ‘chopsticks’! <br/><br/>It was a real treat to have so much space, and especially outside space in the centre of London. This listing is definitely fantastic value for money and we’d definitely stay again."

Destacan la terraza exótica y la amabilidad de Helen, una gran amfitriona.  el barrio es tranquilo, cerca del mercado de Broadway (el sábado) que recomiendo para tener una experiencia auténtica de un Londres sin turistas."
23227018,267985253,2018-05-23,2957649,Sam,Helen’s pad was perfect for us! Very comfortable and easy.
23227018,268193320,2018-05-24,159976779,Erika,The house is rly lovely and colorful !  Would definitely recommend!
23227018,268564803,2018-05-25,177775125,Will,Stayed with 3 friends and couldn’t of asked for a nicer location and home to stay in. Would recommend  to anyone looking for a peaceful stay in London
23227018,269411565,2018-05-27,434202,Maxine,Helen’s place is lovely and very quirky. The photos do not do it justice. Lots of nice touches and the balcony is lovely. <br/><br/>Helen was so helpful with check in and was very relaxed too when our plans changed. <br/><br/>I only popped by the house to check it out due to work commitments - but my friends said they had a lovely stay. And the location was ideal for the festival we went to in Victoria Park. 
23227018,269948555,2018-05-28,188453138,Leone,A lovely hideaway surprisingly quiet and peaceful for London. Beautifully decorated and cosy we were sad to leave.<br/>Great location with nice shops near by and an easy walk to Victoria Park. Helen is a wonderful host. 
23227018,271435711,2018-06-01,165260912,Heike,"Ich war mit meiner Familie (5 Personen) bei Helen. Uns hat es sehr gut gefallen. Helen war sehr gut erreichbar, war mit wertvollen Tipps zur Stelle und ermöglichte uns einen tollen Aufenthalt in ihrer Wohnung. Hackney ist ein interessantes aufstrebendes  Viertel, das sich lohnt näher erkundet zu werden. Das Häuschen war praktisch und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Besonders die Terrasse hatte ein tolles Flair. Uns fehlte an nichts. Leider konnten wir ihre tolle Check-out Zeit von 16:00 nicht nutzen. Wir kommen gerne wieder. Vielen Dank Helen."
23227018,273248960,2018-06-05,28985168,Jai,We had a great experience staying at Helen's. Very clean and organised and well thought out. Helen was always quick to respond and was very understanding. The place is beautifully done and It was a lovely experience overall. Highly recommended.
23227018,275553219,2018-06-11,8213226,Gus,"Great location, clean and cheerful with a friendly helpful host"
23227018,277042564,2018-06-15,10072585,Matthew,This space felt like home.  I loved having a piano and bookshelf’s full of diverse books.  The outdoor space was great for eating and enjoying a glass of wine.  Close to bus and London above ground line.
23227018,278664447,2018-06-18,3266204,Sini,"Persoonal place with lots of room and amenities in the bathroom. Kids really liked the ""secret room"" with one bed. Great balcony!!! <br/><br/>Breakfast is just small things to get started as Helen said, so better to visit the nearby shop as well. "
23227018,280101596,2018-06-22,98865516,Anjali,"I highly recommend staying at Helen’s place. It is cheerfully decorated, clean, and comfortable - it was so wonderful sitting on the terrace amongst all the plants on a warm evening. Helen’s place is within walking distance of shops, restaurants, grocery stores and public transit which makes traveling a breeze. Helen is also very communicative and responds to any questions in a very timely manner. She worked with me through some misunderstandings (on my part) which required a lot of patience on her end. Also- if you’re like me and love to read on holiday, Helen’s library is so expansive- there is something for everyone!"
23227018,281136190,2018-06-24,177623818,Sammy,Our stay was incredibly comfortable and our host was so friendly and generous. The place was gorgeous and quirky with most fabulous sun terrace. Despite being near the centre of London the area was so quiet and peaceful. We would definitely love to stay there again should the need arise.
23227018,284892672,2018-07-02,170818101,Emily,was such a lovely stay!! very nice place very close to everything and easy to navigate around. helen was a lovely host and made everything super easy and comfortable x
23227018,286996182,2018-07-07,170245050,Michael,"Charming eclectic flat with lots of thoughtful little things that all contributed to a wonderful stay.   When we arrived, there was fruit and breakfast items available which held us over until we were able to visit a nearby grocery to stock up for the week.<br/><br/>It’s located in a lovely area where access to the Overground, 242 and 55 routes made easy trips everywhere we wanted to go.  Even closer than that is the Stantander Cycle rental, which was an easy way to wander Hackney and Shoreditch areas on our own timetables.  The nearby Broadway Market is a short walk along the canal.<br/><br/>Certainly would look to stay here again on a return trip to London."
23227018,288292787,2018-07-09,75249451,Alberto,"Helen was an amazing host, since the beginning she was keen to make our stay as easy as possible. The house was perfect with plenty amenities, close to train station, local supermarkets and everything<br/>5 out of 5"
23227018,289770872,2018-07-13,14774539,Veronique,"Helen est une superbe hôte et a un super appartement plein de chaleur bien placé par rapport à la gare et au cœur de Londres. Si comme nous vous avez la chance d'y aller quand il fait beau, vous pourrez profitez de sa charmante terrasse qui donne l'impression d'être dans un petit jardin à la campagne ! Merci pour tout, on conseille !"
23227018,367170929,2019-01-04,7208374,Aniruddh,Great place and good location. Helen is a very responsive and accommodating host

23279657,292101798,2018-07-17,38490137,Francesca,This place is a real gem and Louise was such a great host. Don't look any further ! 
23279657,294751305,2018-07-22,57216151,Darren,"Louise and her family are lovely hosts.  The bedroom is very big, light and clean, with shutters for privacy.  The bathroom is very clean and light with a big shower.  While the space is shared with Louise's family the bedroom and bathroom are separate so it feels like your own space.  Louise has tea/coffee making facilities in your room, or you can join the family for breakfast etc.  We stayed on a beautiful sunny morning and had breakfast in the lovely back garden.  Louise recommended local places to eat and where to watch the bus into the city. The street is wide, has easy parking if you have a car and is close to shops, cafes and a local pub.  It is a nice place, not too far from central London to stay."

23288888,263237620,2018-05-11,164677253,Nicolas,Très sympathique !
23288888,265239300,2018-05-16,158637810,Kirsty,Its a great apartment and Karim was super nice but we struggled with the noise from the street affecting our sleep. Not just the traffic; its right next to a bus stop and we could hear voices on the street too - it went on all night. Earplugs definitely required. If the bedroom windows closed more tightly it would probably be better.
23288888,267202532,2018-05-21,121284714,Kalpesh,"It was a fabulous place, accessible from two tube stations. The apartment was clean and cozy. The location was central and just a couple stations away from Oxford Circus. The host, Karim, was always available, helping us whenever we needed anything. Had a memorable time in London and the apartment. "
23288888,269382964,2018-05-27,12584196,Giulietta Giuly,Beau appartement en quartier bien localisé..un peu bruyant la nuit...conseil: Demandez l’adresse à l’hôte car le site ne l’indique pas bien...
23288888,272916805,2018-06-04,187425383,ManMan,"The accommodation is convenient which near to supermarket and underground. It is large for 6 people staying. Karim is helpful when we meet problems, he helped us quickly!"
23288888,277467388,2018-06-16,61887974,Brian Thomas,"I would have rated this 2.5 out of 5 stars but AirBnB doesn’t have that option. <br/><br/>Pros - 12 minute walk to shopping area, 5 to 10 minute walk to three gorcery stores, 10 minute walk to the Tube and 1 minute walk to the bus stop. Also lots of coffee shops and Middle Eastern restaurants.<br/><br/>Apartment is clean.  It looks, and stocked, as advertised.  Affordability is also a big plus. <br/><br/>Cons - Apartment is just a floor above a busy bus station and chain of restaurants which can get very loud. Closing the window isn’t an option because it gets hot due to no airconditioning. In fairness, unavailability of airconditioning is mentioned in the details.<br/><br/>Worst days of 12 day stay was the first and last. First day my family and I arrived at 8am and were only given the key at 3pm despite a specific previous agreement with host that early arrival is fine.  Host would not answer phone calls or emails until 3pm, and he sent someone else to hand over the keys.  Imagine jet lagged and coming from a transcontinental flight with luggage and kids and not having a place to stay for 7 hours.<br/><br/>Weekends can get loud a floor below due to lots of talking in the restaurants. But on the last day of our stay, on a Friday night (perhaps due to an Iran football match, entire area seems to be a Middle Eastern sector) the street below was so loud because sports cars lined the streets revving their engines for no reason and played loud music from 10pm until 3am. Not even closed windows and bearing the heat inside could keep the noise down. We all lacked sleep and barely had time to rush to the airport for our flight.<br/><br/>Weighing the pros and cons, I wouldn’t rebook on our next stay."
23288888,282066518,2018-06-26,88595953,Antonio,"I booked 3 nights, but only stayed for 1 night as we barely slept because of the heavy noise and lights from the street. Windows are broken and blinds damaged and don't cover lights from the outside. I also don’t feel  the apartment is really suitable for six people (probably for younger kids)... In addition to it: cleanliness (bad), not enough towels, not enough sheets / covers for both sofas, etc...<br/>I've tried to resolve this directly with Karim but he never responded."
23288888,308397635,2018-08-16,183122834,Atheer,Very clean and beautiful space but its a bit noisy at night 
23288888,342106149,2018-10-28,19004414,Andrea,"L’edificio in cui si trova la casa è molto vecchio e mette parecchia ansia.<br/>La casa è molto più piccola di come appare nelle foto, la cucina e il bagno sono davvero piccoli.<br/>Ritengo sia troppo cara per quello che offre."

It is a little noisy starting in the mid morning, as the street outside is busy, but didn’t bother us.<br/>Quite clean. We didn’t cook but kitchen looked reasonably well stocked."

The apartment is on first floor, very spacious, fully furnished with excellent furniture and all required amenities. <br/>I really enjoyed my stay in the apartment and it was my one of the best Airbnb experience. I also recommend it to others. Thank you Karim for your hospitality"
23288888,545480127,2019-10-12,96678723,Florine,Appartement confortable dans la chambre et dans le salon sur le canapé lit. Petite cuisine avec frigo pratique pour les petits en-cas ( difficile de cuisiner cependant). Quartier agréable animé et secure. Nous recommandons cet appartement.

23288888,553541545,2019-10-24,273513295,Steve,The apartment is well presented in a great location. We used it as a base for a few days of sightseeing. Easily slept 2 adults and 2 children. We eat out while we stayed but we could have used the kitchen to cook. Would recommend and would stay again.

Karim meet us at the apartment so check in was very simple and the photos accurately show what the place looks like. It was very spacious and had good heating."

We totally recommend this place for a long stay! It's well located as well so we could walk to most places we wanted to visit. It's also close to a subway station and bus station.
23340313,250831212,2018-04-06,71565713,Gautam,It’s a beautiful apartment in a great location. Really close to Soho and all the shopping places. The apartment has been tastefully redone and looks great. We had a great time as we were able to walk to a lot of places from there.

Plenty of space, nice sized rooms, each with a private bathroom. Location was convenient to tourist attractions and a few minutes walk to the underground. Robert was a wonderful host and very helpful and responsive when needed. I highly recommend this property and would book again!"
23340313,551437859,2019-10-20,12381883,Andrea,"A very central service apartment, so once you get into the apartment, it gets the job done and I found the space to be uncluttered and relaxing. Amenities are extremely basic given the price point- eg. no soap/shampoo in the bathrooms, only one set of keys for our whole group, and the late or early luggage doesn't really exist. Robert will direct you to a 3rd party service down the street or you may have to awkwardly leave your luggage in the apartment of another Airbnb guest - which is weird for everyone.  So if you are traveling with a group keep in mind that you are paying for the ""space"" and interacting with an Airbnb handler who is running between all the different listings so keep in mind that coordination time as this is an Airbnb business. I  was traveling with an infant and my inlaws and the check-in process was cumbersome and luggage dropoff dissapointning (just use the 3rd party service from the getgo)  Robert is on the Airbnb messenger and he gives you the mobile number of his Airbnb handler who is running around so you don't want to give him a hard time, but things like an extra set of keys for a 3 bedroom apartment (because you will clearly be a group on different schedules) are basics which are easy to fix ."

23340313,462857172009432654,2021-09-30,269454236,Justine,"I was very surprised of the title of this listing. I am not a real estate agent, I am a traveler so it doesn’t matter to me if the flat worth £8 million, what matters to me is to stay in a flat fully equipped, especially if I pay £15k / month. I was disappointed to find out that there was a lot of missing essentials:  hangers, frying pan, scissors, drying rack (…). <br/>Also, the beds are very, very hard. On the good side, once we mentioned it, we got all of what was missing quickly. The flat is well located, it’s central and convenient and the team that was taking care of the flat : bob and his family, are the best. They were nice and efficient. We got a few complimentary cleanings because we stayed for a month, which is very nice as well."

The property was occupied by someone when I get there and the occupant told me the property already rented to her.

Awesome pub! <br/>-the room was clean and exactly as she described!<br/>-her pets were really sweet! The dog, Jeremy was such a love bug!!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- first night she had a friend over and were pretty loud and kept waking us up in the night by them laughing and talking. She apologized for this the next morning. (Second night was very quiet).<br/>- wish she had moved the litter box out of our bathroom.<br/>-the room is extremely small when you pull the bed out, wouldn’t recommend staying here for long periods or if you plan to be at her place for hours on end ... although - you’re in London, so why would you be! <br/><br/>Very nice host, would recommend her to anyone that’s comfortable staying at an Airbnb that doesn’t mind sharing living space with the owner!<br/>"

23761279,311393961,2018-08-21,175307361,Michelle,Sophie and Sharon (And Chris and Jerry) are super friendly. If there was a problem or question they helped us immediately. <br/>We were able to use everything and eat on their dining table. It was never too loud and they let us our privacy when they also were at home. <br/>Chris (the cat) and Jerry (the dog) are super nice animals which were really calm. <br/>The flat was really nice located. The Hyde Park is 3 minutes away and the next underground 5 minutes. But there was no traffic noise. <br/>We had such a great time and would love to come back! <br/>
23761279,315628501,2018-08-29,73474680,Andrea,"Excellent apartment near Hyde Park, only 2 minutes walking.<br/>It’s exactly like the photos with the cat and the dog.<br/>Sophie and Sharon were friendly and flexible with the check-in and check-out."
23761279,323774970,2018-09-16,29232839,Corentin,"Very good place in Sophie’s flat, near Hyde Park, Nothing Hill and Oxford street. Very easy to move by Bus or Subway in London. Everything was very clean, accessible and the animals (Jerry & Chris) were lovely. Thanks for everything and see you next time maybe."
23761279,327710072,2018-09-24,10912393,Clement,"Sophie’s apparemment is the best value you can have in London! The location is amazing (10min walk from the Lancaster Gate station (central line) and 5min from Hyde Park). From there you easily go every where in London in no time (Notting Hill is one stop away and Oxford Street is only 4)! The place is super cosy and clean. The private bedroom was very nice and fully equipped. I really felt like I was at home. Sophie, her friends are super friendly and her pets are very quiet. I specially appreciated the fact that Sophie’s agreed with early and late checkin/checkout to match the train arrival and departure time. I will definitely go back there next time I go to London!"
23761279,347324953,2018-11-11,96660754,Wilson,Had a wonderful experience at Sophie and Sharon’s place. They were a great hosts. We had a long chat despite them coming back home late from work. Spent quite alot of time with Jeremy (dog) and Chris (cat) too. They were so friendly and cute! <br/><br/>Its near and easy to reach from Lancester Gate train station and bus stops. It is also right beside Hyde Park which is beautiful. <br/><br/>The apartment is very clean even with 2 fur babies around. We would definitely want to go to Sophie and Sharon’s home again the next time we visit London :)

23761279,427233029,2019-03-23,118310382,Jessica,"Absolutely loved the convenient location of Sophie's place. It's about a 7 minute walk to Lancaster Gate, Bayswater, and Queensway stations which link you to a lot of direct train lines to see all the major sights in London. The room is quite small but very cosy, love the pressure of the shower. Please note that their cat has diabetes so you will wake up to a one or more pee spots in the apartment. Wasn't a problem for us because we love animals and really enjoyed playing and cuddling with their chihuahua and cat! Thanks Sophie!"

Their dog is super friendly and they’re not loud hosts but chill overall. Even though the bed is a pullout it’s really big and comfortable, enough for 2 people."

The location was fantastic, in a beautiful area that was very close to an underground station and Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens. The apartment was very comfortable and quiet, making for a great base to explore central London. Sophia and Sharon were really good hosts, making check-in very easy and regularly responding to any messages we had. Jeremy, Chris and Coco were very quiet and friendly animals and are incredibly cute; we looked forward to seeing them in the morning! All up, we would recommend staying here!"

The space was as promised and her pets are adorable! The location is fabulous with easy access to amazing restaurants, coffee shops and the tube.

He uses ill words and threatenes to pay in cash instead of paying to Air bnb. His house sucks and smells like shit there are hair everywhere and and kitchen is super dirty with food everywhere.

The local farmers market is on Wednesday’s, Friday’s, and Saturday’s. The selection of goods is enormous besides the typical farmer goods. The market is a few bus stops away from the flat.<br/><br/>In addition, the market is part of the Liberty Shopping Center, so excellent proximity to local businesses. There is a movie theater part of it to boot.<br/><br/>Cheng’s room comes with a keyed lock, so your belongings are safe.<br/><br/>Cheng is very polite and his hospitality is warm and welcoming.

24735277,271150206,2018-05-31,16011026,Inna,"The communication with Bin is very nice and quick. All requests were answered within minutes, which made the planning of the trip very easy. The appartment is perfectly located for a short trip. <br/>Unfortunately, the appartment was partly very dirty, especially the toilet and the shower. Both looked like it hadn‘t been cleaned for a while. The flushing didn‘t work at all. We were staying in Bin‘s appartment with four people for one night. We shared the rooms and the sanitary facilities. A functioning toilet is basically one of the most important things people need in a house, no matter how long the stay is. As for the shower, we had the feeling, as if we were sharing it with a bunch of people who were staying there before.  "

Cet appartement est bien pour dormir mais pas y rester la journée.<br/>L'accueil par Bin a été très bien, nous sommes arrivés à l'appartement à l'heure qui nous convenait."
24735277,280116476,2018-06-22,80708059,Ratih,"I like staying at Bin’s place. The location is great, only takes 5 mins walking to tube station and so many coffee shop nearby. The only low point was it’s located at the 3rd floor, so we had to carry our large luggages by stairs (travel with my 9yo son so he couldn’t help much). Yet, it was my personal issue, no biggies. Also, the wifi device was great speed. Thanks, Bin!"
24735277,284939983,2018-07-02,188189093,Ammaar,"Dirty facilities, held us up for over an hour because of an incompetent host leaving the keys, avoid lile the plague. did not offer us a full refund."

Si bien es un poco chico, la ubicación es PERFECTA ya que está frente a la estación Euston y a pocos minutos a pie de King Cross (además tiene una casa de cambio para comprar libras esterlinas pegado al edificio). Y a menos de 15 minutos de caminata de barrios increíbles como Fitzrovia o el Soho. <br/>La limpieza y los utensilios para la cocina son los ideales para poder cocinar algo y todo estaba muy limpio. Además, Silvia fue super amable y atenta, solucionando todos los inconvenientes de manera inmediata y con la mejor predisposición (fueron días de un calor impensado en Londres y ella consiguió todo lo que necesitábamos). "
24787100,308402375,2018-08-16,105193750,Sophie,"This was a cute little self contained flat in a very good location. As it’s on a main road, it was very loud with the windows open. They did provide a fan though, so sleeping with the windows closed was a fine option "
24787100,593952737,2020-01-17,19601340,Meredith,This is a great space to be connected to all things central London! Best if you don't mind city sounds as there are bars and a busy train station quite close. Silvia is really great at communicating and getting everything set up! Highly recommend this apartment!

Warm en open, ik voelde me gelijk thuis. Ik heb niet veel tijd met haar kunnen doorbrengen, maar volgens mij is ze een geweldig persoon om een avond mee door te brengen!<br/>Als ik nog eens naar Londen ga, zal ik zonder twijfel eerst checken of haar kamer vrij is. Grote aanrader!!!"

This is we call feel-at-home. <br/><br/>Before checking-in, Ruth approached me in advance with every details even a photo guide of how to find the building. Even though there are 45E/45C in the same building. <br/><br/>After checked-in, I found the bed really comfortable, I also got a free bottle of water, one body gel. <br/><br/>Then you have full access to the Kitchen. <br/><br/>This place is close to Heathrow airport, but I can't hear any airplanes all day. <br/>Just 200 meters to Ealing broadway Metro station. You have many food stores with walking distance.<br/><br/>The communication with Ruth had been really a pleasure. <br/>Highly recommend for other tourists."

24880026,278630188,2018-06-18,6681341,Saiful,"I stayed two nights at Lucinda’s small but efficient apartment in fashionable upscale Chelsea, London.<br/><br/>The flat would be perfect for not more than two guests. It looked as if it has been recently refurbished with new wooden floors, spanking clean bathroom (with a rain shower!).<br/><br/>The flat also gives access to a courtyard where one can sit down for a bit of fresh air. The flat is airy and bright.<br/><br/>The best thing about the flat is that it is between two main roads, Brompton Rd and King’s Rd, both lined with stylish shops, cafes and restaurants yet the property was tucked at the end of a very short quiet street. <br/><br/>Checking-in was a breeze and same with checking out. <br/><br/>While it might not be ideal for a first-time tourist/visitor to London but it is fantastic for someone who would like to enjoy London in an upscale location and having and fuss-free and kindly host."
24880026,280952958,2018-06-24,7317888,Claire,"The apartment is cosy, clean, well-equiped, well-furnished... and perfectly located to visit London.

This flat could not be more perfect for a stay in London.

The flat is a five minute walk to the nearest tube station which will put you on the Circle or District lines that take you straight down into central London. Grocery store and bank are about a block away. Neighborhood was extremely safe and very quiet at night. The flat itself was the perfect size for the two of us - comfortable bed, fast wifi, and a full kitchen. Lucinda was flexible with us on check-in which really helped! Would stay here again! "

24880026,404524049,2019-01-24,192511105,Peter,"Lucinda very rightly has a super host tag, the property is super too. Some guests aren’t used to central London properties. This may be a mews basement ( I have stayed in a few) but it is the best quality I have stayed in. Lovely fittings, best quality towels and spitlessly clean. Highly recommend and as i’m in the area on business a lot I will return asap"
24880026,405063131,2019-01-26,38850268,Steve,This is a most magnificent basement flat with the owners living above.  There are some steep stairs going down which might be a put off for less mobile people but this is really typical of London.  I was there for business purposes and it was such a better option than a hotel.  The decor is modern with warm underfloor heating. Super comfortable bed and I got a great night sleep. Lucinda is a great host and very welcoming.  Fast Internet.  Just can't fault it.

Felt  safe and secure., as  a single female travelling on my own for the first time.What more can I say.<br/>Thank you Lucinda."

24880026,505493525,2019-08-09,5091766,Emily,"Lucinda’s apartment is one of the best Airbnb stays yet. It’s in a fantastic location close to all the good bits of west London, the tube is five minutes away, the park is ten minutes away, it’s spotlessly clean (literally spotless) and Lucinda herself is lovely. <br/><br/>If it’s available - book it."
24880026,507249457,2019-08-11,138996582,Emilie,"Lucinda's flat could not have been more perfect for our stay in London this trip. The neighborhood is quiet, quaint, and safe,  and there are lots of shops and restaurants nearby. The South Kensington tube stop is super easy to walk to, and it's very easy and inexpensive to get to her flat from Heathrow. Lucinda is the perfect combination of being unobtrusive to the guests but is super available if you need anything at all. The flat is completely private and has some atypical nice amenities like an iron/ironing board. We will definitely book here again if we're able to get back to London in the future!"

24880026,523810582,2019-09-04,65921143,Jillian,"We loved our stay at 13 Guthrie Street! The flat was the perfect size for my husband and I to share for 4 nights spent exploring London. It was extremely clean, comfortable, and newly updated as the photos indicate. We can definitely see why Lucinda is a superhost, we could tell she puts a lot into keeping her place comfortable for her guests and she also left oatmeal, teas, and some shower soaps which were very convenient for us as travelers. We mostly took the Underground to get around the city, so it was a big plus that the flat is so close by to several of the main routes. We felt safe walking around at night and really enjoyed some of Lucinda’s local recommendations for breakfast & coffee. We wouldn’t hesitate to book this for a return visit to London!"
24880026,530096114,2019-09-15,24598227,Dorothy,Lucinda’s lovely flat is a haven of piece and calm in a great area of London. This was my 2nd visit and my husband and I look forward to our next. The flat has all that you need. The kitchen allows for eating in if you need to take a little break but there is lots to explore very close by and easy transportation to get you there. <br/>Thank you Lucinda for all that you offer.
24880026,532216202,2019-09-19,25469190,Cory,Thanks for your exceptional hospitality! You have a beautiful and clean home which I felt privileged to visit.
24880026,535357249,2019-09-24,140799271,Annette,"Este es un piso gracioso con buena luz natural, tranquilo, limpio y encantador, ubicado a pocas cuadras de la estación de metro (the Tube) South Kensington, con una anfitriona maravillosa!  La casa queda en el fondo de un callejón sin salida muy tranquilo, y el piso tiene entrada privada por el jardín bajando por unas escaleras de hierro.<br/><br/>El vecindario es bueno, con excelentes restaurantes y pubs, y se camina una media hora para llegar al museo Victoria y Albert y a Harrod’s en la zona vecina de Knightsbridge.  <br/><br/>Las comunicaciones con Lucinda fueron rápidas y cordiales; respondió de una vez y con lujo de detalle a todas mis preguntas.  Por ejemplo, la forma más rápida de llegar desde el aeropuerto London Heathrow (LHR).  Lucinda, quien vive arriba, fue mi experta, siempre respondiendo con recomendaciones muy acertadas.  <br/><br/>El piso consiste: cuarto de dormir, cuarto de baño, sala/cocina combinada.  Hay unos tres o cuatro escalones en el piso.<br/><br/>El cuarto de baño es pequeño, tiene ducha moderna con muy buena presión y temperatura, buenas toallas, jabón líquido, shampoo y acondicionador de marca Moulton Brown.  <br/>La cama queen es sumamente cómoda con sábanas, almohadas y cobija de calidad.  Las cortinas oscurecen la habitación muy eficientemente.<br/><br/>La cocina es moderna, blanca, bien equipada, con nevera, hornillas, microondas, tetera de hervir agua casi instantáneamente y una cafetera “French press”.  Le agradecimos a Lucinda que nos dejara café, azúcar y un litro de leche.  <br/><br/>Hay Televisor en la sala con canales como BBC y programación de Netflix. La sala tiene sofá, una mesa que abre para usar como comedor y dos sillas.<br/><br/>Los mejores restaurantes cercanos (recomendados por Lucinda): Le Colombier (francés) y Riccardo’s (italiano), ambos excelentes.  Un restaurante atractivo, PJs, abre temprano y sirve desayuno, brunch, almuerzo y cena.  <br/><br/>En resumen, el piso es acogedor y perfecto para una pareja o una persona sola, situado en un buen vecindario cerca de todo y  del metro.   Todo lo encontré de primera y las comunicaciones con Lucinda fueron rápidas y excelentes.  <br/>Con gusto lo reservaría de nuevo en una futura visita a Londres y se lo puedo recomendar sin reservas.<br/>Thank you, Lucinda!"

24880026,540930280,2019-10-04,99760670,Graham,"I highly recommend Lucinda’s self-contained apartment.  It’s quietly tucked away in the corner of a pretty no-through street in a stylish part of London and an easy walk from South Kensington tube station.  It is stylishly decorated, spotlessly clean and Lucinda was responsive and welcoming as host.  I am looking forward to coming back!"
24880026,545471307,2019-10-12,28950803,Hilda,"The location is superb, and if you like walking rather than public transport, you can pretty much walk to a lot of interesting places in 15 minutes, provided it’s not raining. Would recommend L’Eto nearby for breakfast and delicious salad lunches, and Toms Kitchen for dinner. All within walking distance. <br/>Lucinda is the perfect host, very welcoming and easy going."
24880026,546045449,2019-10-13,55901422,Tom,"It was perfect: great location, quiet, clean and Lucinda is a brilliant host. Lots of thoughtful touches that made our stay even better."
24880026,547920581,2019-10-16,8367264,Thomas,"There are times when I would like to award 6 stars to most categories. And I am in full agreement with her Superhost status (takes one to know one as I am also a Superhost for my Airbnb listing in the US). <br/>I believe communication is very important - quick and timely responses to queries. She gets 6 stars in this important category.<br/>Cleanliness is the first thing you are aware of when you enter your booking - another 6 stars!<br/>Location is ideal! 10 minute walk from the South Kennsington station. Two wonderful local pubs 5 min away and several great restaurants all there in her handbook (couple of suggestions left by us).  Food and Wine store up a few blocks on Cale Street open to 11 having everything you need for your stay.<br/>The glorious Victoria and Albert museum (one of my favorites) is close by then skip down to Harrod’s Food Hall for mouthwatering options.<br/>A warm and engaging host, ideal location and a spotless apartment in a very QUIET location. What else can be added!? Can’t wait to return to London and stay here again."
24880026,551440569,2019-10-20,42408422,Katie,Thanks Lucinda for being so helpful on messaging and being so flexible with our changes. Lovely flat in a great area : )

Stylish and contemporary. Very clean and comfortable. <br/>Very convenient location, close to Kings Rd. Very quiet for a good nights sleep. <br/>We would definitely stay again.  Thank you for everything. B & E"
24880026,577953838,2019-12-16,1273469,Rachel,"We had a lovely and comfortable stay at Lucinda’s.<br/><br/>Excellent location in a quiet clean neighborhood. Very close to the South Kensington tube station that can take you anywhere in London. This neighborhood has a few small food vendors, shops, restaurants and coffee shops all in walking distance. <br/><br/>The apartment was clean, with all the amenities we could ever need: heated floors, extra adapters, Molton Brown and Elemis bath products, fully equipped kitchen, iron, snacks, tv, luggage rack, and private secure entrance. Excellent water pressure in the shower.<br/><br/>The bed was comfortable. There were plenty of drawers and a wardrobe with hanging space for our clothes. <br/><br/>Lucinda was the most gracious host. She was very helpful with recommendations and immediately responded to any questions we had. She also accommodated our arrival and depart times helping us with our luggage. <br/><br/>We highly recommend staying here and hope to stay here again on our next trip to London. Thank you for hosting us!"

It is within walking distance of all that Knightsbridge has to offer and you come home to wonderfully hot power showers! Unexpected little bonus - a little Christmas tree, a time of Scottish shortbread and a lovely little daughter who offers to carry your bags!! Definitely coming back."
24880026,589634264,2020-01-06,46578360,Sophie,Really lovely flat and brilliant location.  Lucinda is very quick to respond to questions and provided clear instructions about how to find the flat.  Would highly recommend and hope to return sometime.

Lucinda is the most thoughtful host and her flat was super clean, well equipped and is literally a 4 minute walk from the hospital.  A beautiful flat in an excellent location for sightseeing London (if you dont have a relative in hospital!)"

Slept exceptionally well, felt very safe and right at home. Finishes and fittings are top notch in the flat, including the Molton Brown soaps. Lucinda is the icing on the cake. Such a sweetheart who gave a warm greeting but also ultimate privacy. Perfect!"

The beautiful apartment is 4 minutes from the Marsden which is the reason for the booking.  <br/>The apartment is warm, immaculate, comfortable and a wonderful quiet haven to come back to after a day visiting in the hospital. <br/>Lucinda and her husband recommended places to eat and are a fountain of local knowledge.<br/>I am looking forward to returning to stay in better circumstances!"

24880026,458471202787283520,2021-09-24,43681385,Seline,Chic and tranquil apartment located in the heart of South Kensington and Chelsea. Easy access ( 5 mins walk) to iconic King’s  Road. My host Lucinda is super helpful and fully responsive when I ask for help. She is also a caring  and thoughtful person who supported me when a little unexpected accident happened to me. I would recommend Lucinda and her beautiful apartment to friends who want a short stay in London.

24880026,470096558078125239,2021-10-10,178900628,Mason,"This home is located away from all the traffic of London tucked away at the end of Guthrie St. with a stunning patio. When we walked into the kitchen space, we saw Lucinda left some treats, coffee and tea, and the kitchen stocked with pots and pans. The bedroom/bathroom floors are heated which is a nice touch at night when it gets cooler. The rainfall shower felt so nice after a long day of walking. Super safe and walkable area close to the bridge into Battersea and nearby Kensington as well. Lots of public transportation in walking distance. The only downside of Lucinda’s place was that it is the lower level space so you have to take a small narrow staircase down and when you get inside, the spaces are pretty narrow. It would’ve been no problem for us but we had big trunks of equipment for a job that we had to maneuver down those stairs. Still worth it for the location though, just be aware if you are concerned about stairs or if you need handicap accessible spaces. Lucinda was extremely communicative and even let us stay over the check out time so that we could explore more before heading out to the airport which was so so generous of her! If you get the chance, we highly recommend staying here because Chelsea is a dream to live in even for a few days!"

Walking distance to restaurants and shops, museum, buses and tube station. <br/>At the end of a short dead-end road on the lower floor.<br/>Comfy bed, complimentary amenities for the bathroom and in the kitchen,  big fridge and freezer, microwave and oven, nothing is missing really.<br/>Lucinda is super reactive and very helpful.

La cocina estaba bien  y ella muchas veces se ofrecí a lavar las cosas que utilize. Lo de las cámaras en pasillo de entrada y cocina, me sorprendió un poco, pero entiendo que puede ser por seguridad, lo demás estuvo bien. "

25224522,275018082,2018-06-10,28101439,Edouard,Nice flat for our 1 night stay in London. Very close to Clapham Junction station. The flat is modern and seems quite new. Overall it was a nice stay and good value for this area
25224522,276322071,2018-06-13,150545001,James,"Antonio is an excellent host, and he has a perfectly presented, tastefully set out and very well located flat.  Everything was just as described and our stay was most enjoyable."
25224522,277453897,2018-06-16,136972989,William,"This place is great, really clean space with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Really nice personal touches like the welcome message on the info board, and bottles of water. Would happily stay here again and would gladly recommend to others! Antonio was great with communications and even helped us in returning a left behind pair of headphones!"
25224522,293413923,2018-07-20,22987321,Chris,The flat is incredibly well prepared; I really liked the milk in the fridge and other essentials which was so nice to have on arrival. Everything from a range of soaps in the bathroom to fans around the flat as well as clear wifi instructions and TV use made our 4 day stay so easy. It is a great place to stay being a short walk from Battersea Park which we enjoyed and there is a short cut to walk to Clapham junction. I would really recommend Antonio's place.
25224522,294495765,2018-07-22,145125679,Constantin,The flat was very clean and cozy. Antonio was friendly and uncomplicated

25224522,342039930,2018-10-28,37414831,Chris,"The pictures do not do the property complete justice. Modern, clean, comfortable with kick-ass central heating, no-one was getting cold here! Easy 20 minute walk to Battersea park, 2 minutes from Clapham Junction station with bars and restaurants in abundance. Antonio was clear and in communication from the beginning, definitely the most pleasant airbnb i have stayed in over the last few years heading to London. No hesitations with returning here in the future. Thanks again"

25224522,407960037,2019-02-03,17226824,Rod,"Antonio's flat is in a great location, very close to all amenities of Clapham and so easy for bus and rail connections elsewhere. The flat is very well presented, comfortable and very clean, Antonio was a perfect host responding quickly to any queries we had and managing to extend our stay when asked. The flat is very modern, secure and the onsite secure parking a real bonus. Thank you Antonio, we would be very happy to recommend your home to anyone."
25224522,421841034,2019-03-10,181645608,Ben,nice clean spacious apartment
25224522,431632645,2019-04-01,240474501,Drew,High quality air bnb and a host that makes it easy on you. My first trip to London and not having to worry about where I was staying was comforting when we walked into the apartment for the first time. Highly recommend!
25224522,432522646,2019-04-04,236471010,Henry,"Well thought out, stylish, and convenient accommodation. We stayed with our 4 and 6 year old (who shared the bedroom) and it was a perfect launch pad to explore London. Have no hesitation in recommending this place to future travellers, indeed we may stay here again!"
25224522,447363561,2019-05-03,146292993,Chris,"Hyper clean, very comfortable and a great situation for transport, shops & restaurants. Trains every few minutes for central London. Can not fault this flat"
25224522,450113961,2019-05-08,80235719,Paul,"What can I say..... from the minute I booked the apartment to the moment we left, Antonio was there to make our stay more enjoyable with no stress or fuss.<br/>Communication was excellent and the apartment even more amazing.<br/>I cannot recommend Antonio enough.<br/><br/>Thanks for everything and thanks for letting us stay in your lush apartment"
25224522,450737347,2019-05-10,232361636,Coral,"Excellent home, excellent location (very close to the train (less than a 10 minute walk) and then only a 5 minute ride to London to catch our Hop on Hop off bus!  <br/>The kitchen was very well stocked with breakfast foods and the addition of fresh fruit and bottled water was a nice surprise!  <br/>Sparkling clean and fresh. Everything provide to make for a very comfortable stay in our home away from home!<br/>Thank you so much Verity and Antonio for being such excellent hosts!!"
25224522,458593805,2019-05-26,153105335,Gurjot,"Great place to stay, close to main shops and the communication was great."
25224522,464725745,2019-06-06,194670146,Selina,Had a lovely time in London Antonio.<br/>The apartment was everything we needed and more. The little welcome message on the chalk board was a so cute and my dad loved it. Loved that you had the Rocky anthology as they’re my faves and I snuggled up watching 1 late at night after a hectic day!! lol!! I would definitely stay again in the future and thanks for being so nice. X<br/>Selina.
25224522,467929044,2019-06-11,32720477,Ruth,"Super convenient to London and the train station. Sparkling clean and very modern. We appreciated the fruit, coffee, tea, and toast! Great, quick responses. Love to stay again sometime."
25224522,476879690,2019-06-27,157020286,Chasty,伦敦的三晚全部选择住在这里了。房子位置很好，距离著名观光地都并不是太远，交通非常方便。小区隔壁是一个公园，房子的后院墙壁上经常有只松鼠光顾，儿子非常喜欢他。整个房子非常干净､舒适，厨房用品齐全。
25224522,528648453,2019-09-13,41368038,Christopher,Great place to stay for a few nights very close to the train station. Flat was very clean and had what we needed. Only issue we had was the drain in the shower was not working well and caused the bathroom floor to be wet. Antonio said he would fix it once we left but a plunger would have helped. Overall was a good stay.
25224522,531821994,2019-09-18,272798443,易臻,"The apartment is very clean, modern and sweet. Parking for free is very helpful. Antonio is very friendly to solve problems for us. Breakfast is also prepared. The location is very near to the train station, easy to go to wherever u want. Everything is fine only it is loud because of the trains. Every a few minutes comes a train and u can hear it clearly. However advantage and disadvantage comes at the same time. Anyway, it was a good experience."
25224522,534917902,2019-09-23,56251928,Sarah,"This property was perfect from start to finish for our 3 night stay. Little touches like having our names on the blackboard and their contact information was nice. The place is beautifully decorated with new appliances. Breakfast items, milk in the fridge and bread in the freezer  were nice touches after a long journey. The location was absolutely perfect to get to Stamford Bridge and the London core. The area itself was nice and quaint. Every store you’ll need is basically on your doorstep. I would recommend to anyone and hope to return on my next visit to London."
25224522,556681008,2019-10-30,90947215,Jacquie,"Great location- right next to the station and near loads of shops, cafes etc. <br/>Entry and parking was really easy. <br/>Inside was really clean and comfortable."
25224522,597321919,2020-01-25,83107914,Debby,"Love Antonio’ place!  Was very clean and we had everything that we needed.  Gave them a call about needing more towels and they were very prompt with calling back and meeting our needs.  Loved not having to go to the store for essentials the very first thing.  They provide a continental breakfast.  Even though you are close to the station, it is very quiet.  Will definitely book again!"
25224522,608254815,2020-02-20,106915852,Luke,Nice apartment - really convenient for clapham junction station and quick and easy access to central london
25244543,279310978,2018-06-20,73413739,Rob,"Mumtaz and his team are really attentive to details and have been seriously prompt in replying when we needed any sort of information. The house is “immaculate” (as the title says!) and very much spacious and comfortable. Not to mention the location, which is quite handy for transports and amenities. <br/>Thanks very much guys for making us feel like home!"
25244543,289094689,2018-07-11,7800291,Shoko,"Mumtaz’s flat was lovely and professionally managed. One thing to note is that the stairs, as in the pictures, can be quite difficult to navigate with suitcases. Any elderly guests should probably look elsewhere, but otherwise recommended!"
25244543,418929663,2019-03-03,174041732,Tom,"We were very disappointed with this place.  It's way overpriced.  There's a terrible smell in the house.  The bedroom is directly on the main street.  The kitchen is downstairs in the underground area, separate from the rest of the flat.  The beds are uncomfortable.  It would be OK at half the listed price, but they are charging way too much for this place."
25356409,287423825,2018-07-08,52515110,Aisling,"Francis was a great host, picked us up from Gatwick airport on arrival late on a Thursday night. We were coming over in the hope of getting to watch some tennis at Wimbledon the next day, the apartment is a short walk away from the train with the next stop being Wimbledon, this was pwrgwvy for us! The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. The room we stayed in was the top floor and was very spacious with an ensuite and access to a beautiful outdoor terrace. We stayed at the beginning of July when the weather was really hot and so the room did heat up quite a bit, but Francis had pre warned us of this. A great host and location, would highly recommend!"
25356409,313488679,2018-08-25,6700511,Timo,Francis is a friendly host. You'll get quick responses if there are questions. We had a lot of privacy and enjoyed the little terrace on the roof. The room/house is very clean.
25356409,348546250,2018-11-14,26245211,Linda,Spacious clean and (while I was there SUNNY!!) bedroom with en-suite.  Francis was very accommodating with my early arrival and late departure and his place is really close to Raynes Park station with frequent trains to Waterloo. I’ll be back!!
25356409,366114933,2019-01-02,208221329,Brett,"Francis is a great host and the unit is superbly spacious, comfortable, well appointed, spotless, extremely convenient for all forms of transport and very well located. I'll be back next time I'm in London."
25356409,434050537,2019-04-07,26245211,Linda,The second time I have stayed here - just as good as the first. Everything you need is there and it’s so close to rail station! Thanks Francis.  See you soon.
25356409,455050076,2019-05-19,78854439,Sophie,Very nice accommodation at a great location! Francis is a nice person to talk with.
25356409,460785268,2019-05-30,26245211,Linda,Always a pleasure to stay at —‘Approachable’. Perfect for Raynes Park Station and shops/restaurants. Thanks again Francis.

25408064,311060529,2018-08-20,205013680,Yadnik,"Daisy is a great host. She communicates effectively regarding any queries that you have. The property itself is sparkling clean. It has all the amenities that you wish for in a home , not just in a BnB. I was a bit apprehensive when I came to know that I would have to share some areas with others. But it didn't have any effect on the cleanliness in any areas, and I had a pleasant experience. Will definitely recommend this for a wonderful stay."
25408064,330072794,2018-09-30,5612683,Vivek,"Excellent houseshare facility, located at walking distance from Twickenham stadium, has a Tesco nearby as well, sparkling clean condition of the house with lot of thoughtful touches. Hosts are very friendly caring and helping. Would definitely love to visit over again."
25408064,365354714,2019-01-01,134378898,Oyuntsetseg,The room was small.The location is fine if you are going to rugby match.
25408064,402413153,2019-01-18,63268808,Chris,Great place and great value. Use as a base for work in the local area. Only slight issue was noise from planes overhead at 6am during the week but at least it meant I didn't have to worry about sleeping in :)
25408064,416839472,2019-02-25,242086793,Azhar,Daisy is marvellous host

25408064,448585528,2019-05-05,172460907,Alison,"This location is fantastic for Twickenham Stadium, not even 10 minutes walk. Tesco across teh road and several bus routes passing by should you need. All round good find!"
25479979,281101188,2018-06-24,91301730,Millicent,"There was absolutely nothing wrong with this place.<br/>The hosts were amazing - we were delayed with getting to the flat because of problems with transport but they were absolutely lovely stayed up for us in order to let us in.<br/>The house was fantastic, everything was clean and facilities like the kitchen, living room and bathroom was sparkling clean.<br/>Pictures show exactly what the place looks like!<br/><br/>The good thing is that the house is about 10 minute walk away from the station, if not less - it takes about 40 minutes to get to the house via tubes and overground from Central, which wasn’t too bad for us, but something people will need to consider, but it does state the location before booking as well.<br/><br/>We also had a lot of luggages and didn’t want to carry it around with us all day, and they were amazing enough to let us leave it in the house on the day of check out and pick it up.<br/><br/>THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR AMAZING HOSPITALITY - 100% would recommend and would come back to stay in! Only good things to say about this place :)"
25479979,288148384,2018-07-09,198692732,Kweku,"We had a really great time and would definitely love to come back! The house is very nice and welcoming, and the room is clean with a very comfortable bed. We also really appreciated that we were given towels. The hosts are a lovely, kind couple who made our stay nice and relaxed. The area is also super convenient, quiet yet full of shops and restaurants and only 5 minutes away from the train station. <br/>Thank you Joseph and Fuzz!"
25479979,292140233,2018-07-17,154847853,Margaux,"We spend a very good stay with Joe and Fuzz; they are pleasant, kind and welcoming! Moreover, the flat is so beautiful, and near to the center of London (40 mins). It was perfect for m’y sister and I. I recommend !!"
25479979,313368639,2018-08-25,5884126,Martin,"Joe and his wife are really nice people with a great taste in music and books. We booked a room with my girlfriend for a couple nights, everything was clean and just as we expected from the photos. The neighbourhood was quiet, park 5 minutes away a great coffees about the same. Subway connection to the center was convenient. Would definitely stay at their place again!"
25537616,325653688,2018-09-20,25907934,Cherie,"Excellent flat and was exactly as the pictures show.  Location is very close to Underground, shopping, restaurants - including a great pub just around the corner.  Appreciated the amount of storage.  Would definitely book again."

Would highly recommend :D"
25537616,427320868,2019-03-23,77071643,Charles,Warm and cosy for a winter stay with excellent bed linens and towels. Peaceful and secluded in a great location. David was responsive and very helpful.

25537616,517422720,2019-08-25,50986985,Nick,"This Flat is absolutely perfect, felt like a home away from home.  David was beyond thorough when it came to communication and instructions.  The location was ideal, nice quiet part of town for relaxing evening strolls, but great access to restaurants, pubs and shopping.  One of the best parts was the extremely close proximity to the Victoria station which made it extremely easy to travel around London and also to travel outside of the city.  I would recommend a stay here to anyone and everyone!!"
25537616,589577036,2020-01-06,7669779,Francesca,L'appartamento è perfetto per una vacanza a Londra. Si trova vicinissimo al centro ed è servito in modo eccellente da bus e metro.<br/>L'appartamento è attrezzatissimo e consente di vivere sia la casa che la città in modo assai soddisfacente.
25537616,592058390,2020-01-12,13872344,Erin,"Great location! We were able to get to museums and attractions easily using the metro station. Lots of fun things to do and see in London, and David's place made a great home base for us to get a good night's rest every night. It was quiet and comfortable! The kitchen is a great size for cooking (although we found great restaurants every night). Couldn't recommend more highly! Can't wait to come back and visit London again soon!"
25537616,596005183,2020-01-21,22964710,Lauren,"David’s place was a perfect home base for 6 nights in central London plus a couple of day trips. The location was ideal. The building was very safe-feeling on a quiet side street. Quick access to the Victoria and Westminster tube stations and plenty to see and do within walking distance. Apartment itself had everything we needed, and a particularly comfy bed. Supplemental fan heaters kept us plenty warm in 40-degree weather. Only downside was the building lift being down all week - so be prepared for lots of steps. David’s detailed communication prior to our trip (great tips for international visitors) was extremely detailed and helpful."

25537616,604125648,2020-02-10,80340511,Michelle,It was located in a great area and the space was generous.  The building elevator had been out of service for some time so it was 70 steps up to the flat.

We also used the 78 bus to get back from London Bridge which drops you off just around the corner. <br/><br/>The house was immaculate and has lots of lovely, homely touches - my family felt immediately at home largely thanks to Sam and Loesje’s  hospitality in all communications. They left helpful notes on local places to check out and my parents also enjoyed relaxing in their lovely private garden. <br/><br/>Nunhead has great restaurants and cosy pubs and we enjoyed an evening exploring the buzzing Peckham nightlife.<br/><br/>Thank you for having us! "
25942988,295872491,2018-07-24,160749479,Sonja,Bests hosts you can imagine! Wonderful home away from home. My child appretiated to have toys he was allowed to play with. We were very happy with all the breakfast items organised for us. And loved sitting in the garden the evenings. London is easy to rwsch from here.

Nous avons eu l'impression d'être accueillis comme leurs amis. De nombreux commerces et restaurants sont à proximité. Sam et sa charmante épouse ont tout fait pour rendre nous séjour au top avec un accueil très chaleureux. Vraiment une adresse que je recommande à tous !
25942988,363701664,2018-12-29,214657407,Caroline,"We had a great time in Peckham/London!<br/>As for the accomodation, everything was more or less perfect. Many things were very personal and thoughtful and really added to our stay becoming nice and memorable. <br/>One last detail; the fox on the neighbouring roof was fantastic! We got many great photos."

I could write a long list beginning with breakfast items organized by Sam and Loesje, paper and colored pencils for our small son till perfect communication before and during our stay; even support to organize Oyster tickets. Their home is cozy, quiet, in a friendly neighbourhood and it was absolutely clean. Train stations, Tesco Express and other shops and restaurants nearby – so I would rate this stay as perfect; Clear recommendation for this accommodation !!"

26120791,283138745,2018-06-29,151430135,Nicolas,Had a great stay!
26120791,284377719,2018-07-01,31632312,Michael,I warmly recommend Abbie's place. Nice comfortable room and location and friendly helpful hosts. They are going to fix a poor hot water supply to shower.
26120791,286405225,2018-07-06,176967167,Abi,"Amazing hosts, very clean and tidy house and I felt very comfortable using the kitchen etc as a guest. Quiet neighbourhood within 5 minute walk to tube station. Can’t rate the hosts enough, so laid back and thoughtful! Will definitely be staying again, thankyou very much."
26120791,289937885,2018-07-13,35147700,Janet,"Abbie was so kind, gracious, warm and welcoming. She accommodated me on my early check-in. Masai was ADORABLE and sweet. The bed was comfortable and warm. I even woke up one day thinking I was at home! The location is very convenient. Close to the city and the attractions. Her crystal collections are beautiful and provide a lot of positive energy throughout the apartment. My only complaint is that the water pressure was low, so it just took a little bit longer to shower. Overall I would highly recommend staying with Abbie. I had a wonderful time in London! "
26120791,290302789,2018-07-14,145778440,Lars,Abbie and Caleb are very nice people and welcoming hosts. I enjoyed staying in their flat and would like to come back another time again! The flat is nicely located with a park just across the street and public transport very close by. I can recommend it very much!
26120791,291780539,2018-07-16,42168731,Kathy,Abbie家中有两间客人房，我住在其中一间没有厕所的，浴室是公用的。Abbie把房间布置得很舒服和干净，就和图片上一样。房间挺大的，阳台窗户外面是一片很大的公共运动场，环境挺安静的。不知道为什么这个区域有很多法国人。离地铁站maida vale走5-6分钟，地铁站的周边我有点不喜欢，因为有碰到有点奇怪的讲法语的老太太搭讪，但是民宿附近还是很不错的。周边有Beatles abbey road studio如果要去尽量趁早，不然我房东说会排队。离notting hill也很近，去portobello市场很方便。有兴趣的话还可以一路兜到little venice那边有很多船屋，或者paddington basin，风景都还不错。Abbie和她的丈夫人都很好，相处起来很轻松，大家一起聊天。早上有Abbie他们提供的麦片和牛奶，厨房可以自由使用。第一次尝试和房东住在一起的airbnb，感觉还不错！
26120791,297128565,2018-07-27,33422250,Mark,"I’ve stayed in many AirBnB places and while most have been satisfactory or better, this one turned out to be one of the very best! A fantastic, stylish, comfortable apartment in a great area (tempted to say posh) and the room comes with a full door balcony! Compared to where I live that IS posh... but all that aside, what really made this stay are the hosts, Abbie and Caleb. I didn’t get to meet Abbie unfortunately but her online communications were prompt, informative, friendly and fun. Her husband, Caleb, I did meet and he’s as nice and friendly and easy-going as you could hope for. Made me feel completely welcome and on my last night we had wine and a long, fun conversation. The kind of welcoming personal interaction that sets the best hosts apart. I will, without any doubts, be booking again. Thanks Abbie & Caleb"
26120791,299539785,2018-07-31,151284276,Julius,Perfect!
26120791,302048685,2018-08-05,65847955,Alexandra,"What a truly exceptional stay. From the super fast and helpful communication to the meet and greet, room, amenities (excellent WiFi, hair dryer, toiletries, fluffy towels, great breakfast, etc.) and location to the wonderful people (and very adorable little dog), everything was just perfect and so much more than I expected.<br/>Firstly the property is very conveniently located, with two underground stations a short and very nice walk away, very easily reached from Heathrow via Paddington. It’s a very quiet, leafy area and really nicely decorated as well as being squeaky clean. And that’s the reason I chose it. But all this is just bonus as the real marvel are your hosts, Abbie and Caleb and of course Messi, the little dog (I want one, too!). They looked after me from meeting me for a welcome drink at the station to local tips and above all such a warm welcome, I felt like I was staying with good friends. Just wonderful! If you come to London, this is the place to stay. Thank you so much, guys! It was a truly wonderful weekend break!"
26120791,306919192,2018-08-13,10583675,Yuting,"Abbie's place is close to the subway (or they call it underground,lol)  and walking distance to Notting Hill if you are a big fan of the movie. <br/>My flight got cancelled and had to take an earlier flight, so I arrived a bit earlier than originally planned and it completed messed Abbie's schedule.  However, she was nice enough to arrange my check in with warm hospitality. Thank you very much!!<br/>I have to also mention their super cute dog - Messi, one of the most adorable puppies I have ever seen and he is super friendly. I miss him a lot!!! I would strongly recommend Abbie's place if you are a dog lover and love to talk to people :)) "
26120791,313513056,2018-08-25,107411026,Robert,"Abbie and Reggie are wonderful hosts. They are very warm and welcoming. I wish I could have stayed a whole week with them.<br/>The bedroom is perfect, the bed is very comfortable. I would certainly recommend staying with them!"
26120791,313958082,2018-08-26,61803640,Massimiliano,simply my best Airbnb experience! 
26120791,316379482,2018-08-31,44345738,Raymond,"As a first time visitor to London, this was a great place to stay. Abbie was such a helpful and fantastic host, the home was warm, cozy, very clean and i felt very safe. I will recommend this to all my family and friends who visit the London area."
26120791,320712751,2018-09-09,19749678,Danielle,Abbie & Reggie were super friendly and welcoming hosts. The room has a wonderful view and Messi is the sweetest cuddly dog - we had some lovely snuggles together.<br/>Great little touches like international adapter and makeup wipes available in the room. I look forward to staying with them again
26120791,323786064,2018-09-16,162409621,Luke,It was a short trip but they were great hosts! They were very helpful in advising me on how best to get around and gave clear directions for arriving to the flat. My flight arrived in the morning and they were helpful in arranging early check-in.
26120791,325947310,2018-09-21,16509617,Heather,"OMG. You have to stay with Abbie and Caleb! They are amazing, kind, and connected people with big hearts. I felt like I was staying with old friends. And their dog-Messi. Oh my Lord.! The cuteness factor is simply off the chain!<br/><br/>Aside from the warm souls you’ll be living with, the room is beautiful. So clean, and the balcony view is incredible. I slept with the balcony door open, because I love fresh air and the sound of the trees. It was perfect for me. The bed is incredibly comfortable and the neighborhood is quiet. I rested so well in this space, and I highly recommend the beautiful park across the street.<br/>There is a breakfast cabinet with cereals, biscuits, milk, teas, and coffee that you can have at anytime.<br/><br/>Abbie and Caleb are artists and activists. Likeminded types will enjoy conversations on topics of importance with them in the evening and at breakfast.<br/><br/>Finally, both were very responsive and helpful when I needed instructions for how to arrive and depart using public transportation.<br/><br/>A couple things to consider-the bathroom is shared with their other AirB&B guest and them. It was always open when I needed it! There are also two flights of stairs to get up to their flat. Caleb carried my suitcase up (and down!) for me, so it was no problem! <br/><br/>Finally, they happily accommodated my early check in time. <br/><br/>Just stay here. It was the best part of my trip to London!"
26120791,328533067,2018-09-26,181641808,Angela,"Abbie was a great host- so thoughtful and attentive. She responded to messages very promptly and came to pick me up from the tube stop, even though I went to the wrong one! The flat is very close to Maida Vale tube station which made travelling into the centre very convenient. I wish I could have spent more time with them  during my stay."
26120791,332846869,2018-10-06,101834602,Abigail,"Abbie and Reggie are really an amazing, thoughtful, sweet, helpful and nice Hosts!   It is my first time to travel in London and my first time to try Air Bnb and this 2 (plus Messi and Fredrick) made me feel that I am indeed in a HOME away from Home...  <br/><br/>Their house is very neat, tidy & stylish. You can help yourself in the kitchen as they offer free breakfast like cereals, biscuits and tea. My room is quite big and has a balcony with a great view of the park and track field across the street. They have a very nice and quite neighbor and very accessible to Underground Tube  which is one of my preference. They have a Clean bathroom with complete toiletries which is shared with them.<br/><br/>When I came, I got little sick because of the weather but they were so kind to offer me medicine and tea to make me feel better.  This is something that I’m really thankful for because not only they welcome me in their home but they make sure that i am taken care of.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed my stay in London and i definitely made the right decision to stay in Abbie and Reggie’s home. I’d definitely be back and stay with them for sure.<br/><br/>Again, thank you guys for the warm welcome and see you soon! "
26120791,337113446,2018-10-15,164338187,Misty,"That's wonderful! Abbie is a really thoughtful host and the place is very comfortable and cosy. There's almost everything I need in the room and even a little blackboard written on ""welcome to our home Misty"" which really makes me feel surprised and warm. Also thanks Caleb for helping me with my luggage. Really do me a favour. <br/>This place is near to the underground station and is right opposite a great garden where you can do some exercises there. I truly recommend it."

Messi, the cutest dog in town will take your heart for ever! You have a balcony with views to a prak so you will hear birds singing and thats a plus!. Trees, nice architecture, great food a walking distance, amazing host... so what else you can ask? Thank you Abbie for all!"

But you also have your space too. The room was beautiful, the location great and breakfast was such a nice touch, lovely coffee every day. The free running track is amazing too. Bed really comfy and lovely ambience throughout the whole flat! Xx"

26354132,309583647,2018-08-18,71771,Maja,"Staying at Charles' place was a fantastic experience! Before and during our trip Charles was easy and fast to reach to make sure we had everything we needed! Still so glad he ensured we could check in and out late. The flat is beautifully furnished with all amenities we needed and more. Location is prime as well, busses and tube on the street, max. 3 minutes away. Absolutely recommend to stay at Charles' flat for a perfect stay in London!!"

Charles and his assistant are very welcoming and responsive to any need you may have. The apartment has anything you need and it's very stylish.

26354132,347331753,2018-11-11,74412364,Kimberly,"Lovely, clean and well decorated flat in a fabulous location near Sloane Square. Quiet overnight with little to no traffic noise. The owners assistant greeted us at check in, but I suggest you call rather than text him, as he wasn't overly responsive to texts. We had issues with the boiler on our last night, but the owner was able to instruct us on how to fix this. Would recommend and return."

Esta situado en una zona hermosa, tranquila, pero con muchas cosas para hacer cerca (restaurantes, centros comerciales, museos, etc) y muy cerca de la parada de metro Sloane Square.<br/>El departamento es muy cómodo y esta perfectamente equipado, además de estar decorado de una forma muy bella. Todo funciona de maravillas y no está demás decir que las camas son muy cómodas!<br/>La comunicación con el anfitrión ha sido de lo mejor. Ha contestado siempre que le hemos escrito y ha sido siempre de lo más amable. <br/>En síntesis,es super recomendable!!!"

26354132,495620012,2019-07-26,27165019,Andria,"My family of four loved staying at this Sloane St. apartment. The porter Florian was kind and helpful showing us around the flat, and available for further questions during our stay. <br/><br/>About the apartment: For London, very spacious and tastefully furnished. So many Airbnb's look thrown together after a quick trip to Ikea; this apartment is instead fitted with understated, elegant pieces, (some beautifully made custom drapery- important for blacking out the rooms!) that made us feel comfortable and at home. There were ample bath towels and the kitchen is well-stocked for cooking as well as coffee/tea basics. <br/><br/>About the location: The best! I have been to London many times, and I think this was my favorite place ""to live"". The flat is less than a five minute walk from the Sloane Sq. Tube station; next door to the building is a small grocer and an Indian restaurant, directly across the street is a pub where we had lunch, and nearby are a slew of high end  shops. Harrods even is in walking distance. During our stay London was experiencing a heat wave-it was a relief to know we could come home to an air conditioned apartment. We had a great stay, and will want to book the flat when we come back!"

26702218,299692728,2018-07-31,768443,Glenn,"Leyla is an outstanding host, she really went out of her way to make me feel at home with amazing hospitality. The flat is newly renovated and I had the place to myself most of the time as Leyla is never home. The location is excellent close to Stoke Newington High street and it's modern cafe's and many buses take you to town in around 30 minutes.  The flat is on a large council estate but certainly one of the nicest ones and very safe and across the road from Clissold park.<br/><br/>I wouldn't hesitate in staying again."

Her house is lovely and sparkling clean, in a great position to enjoy the local amenities such as the beautiful Clissold Park, and just a bus ride away from Highbury & Islington and Angel stations. The area is very quiet, meaning you can get a great night's sleep in the comfy bed without worrying about noises from the road. Leyla is also great at giving advice on activities happening locally, such as book clubs and film clubs. I highly recommend this room as I've thoroughly enjoyed my stay!"

26711277,462513914,2019-06-02,48929426,Elizabeth,"Maru’s home is spacious, beautiful and homely. Close to lots of shops, pubs & restaurants. Also on the doorstep is beautiful Peckham Rye Park and the nature reserve, Nunhead Cemetery -  faded elegance from Victorian days. <br/>The station is a short walk away. <br/>We particularly enjoyed El Vermut bar & bistro. <br/>Overall a vibrant friendly area with easy access to central London."
26711277,509956814,2019-08-15,101632988,Jo,Our stay at Maru’s was really convenient for us. Really close to the station and plenty of trains regularly into central London. House equipped with everything we needed. Speedy helpful communication from Maru too.

26938013,314044576,2018-08-26,96674045,Ashley,"Presley's place is a little gem of a spot for vacationers, walking distance from shops and other conveniences, close to transport links into the heart of the city, and run by the most thoughtful and affable host you could imagine. I would not hesitate to stay there again or to recommend to anyone."
27050023,302196000,2018-08-05,204470506,Angel,Absolutely lovely property. My boyfriend and I stayed here for a staycation weekend and loved it. Besides a few communication issues I would book again.

27050023,304932625,2018-08-10,45828867,Katy,A beautiful flat in a great location for getting into town. The flat was well decorated and the kitchen equipped with everything you might need. The garden is a lovely addition
27050023,360938365,2018-12-22,22319108,Stephy,Nice place but White Rabbit representative was very rude. I would not recommend this company as a result.

27397602,314691933,2018-08-27,39095621,Carlos,"el sitio es bastante aceptable. Se trata de un bajo de un adosado ingles típico de barrio obrero , que pide a gritos  una remodelación sobre todo el baño, <br/>Sin embargo  diré que el menaje  sabanas toallas todo era nuevo y estaba muy bien. Calefacción y agua caliente no falto en ningún momento<br/><br/>  Esta lejos 30-40 minutos del centro pero a 3 minutos del metro y con recomendación de Nassir   se come muy barato en los alrededores y con un super tipo carrefour con unos precios bajisimos. Así que  teniendo en cuenta el precio y sabiendo como es <br/>Londres  pues no es mala opción. <br/>"
27397602,319696938,2018-09-07,10443159,Kieran And Jordan,Nasir was a great host. Check in was super easy and he was very accommodating to our requests. The WiFi and the linen was really good quality. 5 minutes walk to the tube is quite convenient
27397602,322434772,2018-09-13,53968299,Lori,The flat is a nice size for two people.  The kitchen was well equipped.  The location is close to the train station and many restaurants and grocery stores.
27397602,329695236,2018-09-29,65516532,Marlene,"A few issues such as the TV and shower not working, but Nasir was trying to sort it out for us. Unfortunately we couldn't use our bathroom and had to share the main bathroom with the residents living in the house. Nasir sent an electrician to fix it and did what he could do, but unfortunately these things happens and Nasir was trying his best to sort it out.<br/>Apart from this, it's a nice little flat (but should definitely have sound proof walls and doors as we can hear everything from the other people staying in the house!) and it's in a great location. Tube is only a 5mn walk and you have everything you need near. Thanks Nasir for your effort in trying to make our stay enjoyable, it was very much appreciated.<br/>Marlene"

27397602,351011089,2018-11-21,36328311,Saif,"Not fit to host, does not understand the concept of how to welcome a guest. The ""host"" sends a ""welcome"" message by threatening to call the police and remove us before we even turned up or did anything! Appalling."
27397602,355506621,2018-12-04,6574322,Eggo,"Location is very good, a couple of mins from the tube with access to the district, Hammersmith & city line. It is part of a complex of rented apartments. This means you hear people talking and moving around. Not much but you will hear it. We were a bit disappointed in the place. It was not clean. The kitchen also needs diy. And the bed was also run down. That is unfortunate as the location is so good."

27397602,504845405,2019-08-08,253260331,Charly,"It is a lovely place, unfortunately the toilet room has some mould in it and has a weird smell due to the air vent that probably comes from other people’s kitchens, the walls are also almost paper thin so you can hear everything and I was up till 2am most nights due to the house next door screaming, but everything else was as expected and was very nice, the host brought in a new tv on the first day due to the guests before breaking it."
27397602,510520367,2019-08-16,243791368,Cash,"Loved that the place was only a short walk to the train station! Nicely decorated, easy check in, but the only problem is that we found a mouse in the kitchen. However, Nasir was quick to respond to it and said he would get it taken care of ASAP."
27397602,547942737,2019-10-16,274303679,Hassan,"Nasir's place offers an excellent location to set your footing out of East London. Located in a family neighborhood, just off the High Street, you have instant access to the local tube station, ASDA (UK's Walmart) and a range of stores/restaurants."

27561753,326034294,2018-09-21,201754226,Adam,"Really nice apartment on potabello Road. Pushaun's place was great for us as we were working in the area. Communication was great and Check in was straight forward as pushaun met us and shown us around the place which was nice. Also the bottle of champagne was a really nice touch, thankyou!unfortunately we didn't get to spend allot of time in the apartment due to the hours we were working but the place has everything we needed and is really nice, there's also plenty of shops and places to eat. Thanks for letting us stay in your apartment pushaun."
27561753,327004049,2018-09-23,145520120,Graham,"Fantastic location right in the middle things.  Great affordable restaurants right on the doorstep. Really good vibe and not noisy, which is remarkable for where it sits.  <br/><br/>Plenty of stairs, so not for the infirm.  But for everyone else, it's fine. <br/><br/>Bright and airy with high ceilings and good views back and front - recommended!"
27561753,328755980,2018-09-27,38922334,John,"A great experience and great value.  It is a second floor flat right on Portabello Road, not near but right on.   It was active during the day and quiet at night.  Surrounded by interesting restaurants and a nearly by grocery store.  The Underground is an easy walk.  Extra towels were provided.  The kitchen is fully furnished.  The bedrooms are on third floor, and the two bathrooms up and down a half flight."
27561753,331729311,2018-10-03,5118441,Ikhlasmurni,"Pushaun’s house is situated in the heart of Notting Hill just few doors from the famous blue door house from the movie Notting Hill. We reached on friday where there was the Portobello Market. The house consist of three stories with rooms on level 3. All the necessities are available from towel to cooking pots. There are tesco, sainsbury 2 mins away from the house. We travel by bus which was literally 200m from the house to everywhere around London. Tube stations are also 5 mins walk from the house."

Le quartier est vraiment très chouette!<br/>Enfin Pushaun est un hôte attentionné, il nous a lui-même accueilli à notre arrivée pour nous montrer la maison et nous a réservé une petite surprise!! Merci encore!! <br/>Nous recommandons et reviendrons avec plaisir!"
27561753,342772482,2018-10-29,11530003,Kirsten,"Everything is spot on. (I really want to keep all this to myself, because I’m afraid the apartment is taken by others next time we go to London.)<br/>Great apartment with all you need. Prime location. Close to  the tube. Right in the best part of the Portobello market. Lovely restaurants right outside the door and a very nice and caring host. <br/>Cheers<br/>Kirsten & Petter"
27561753,344010463,2018-11-02,27626965,Sophie,"Charming flat , very nice and pleasant area. Pushaun has warmly welcome us and everything was fine. We spent nearly a week as if we were londonien is this little 3bed rooms house . This house has everything you need, it is stylish with this ""crazy blue"" floor and you feel very good inside."

27561753,350783830,2018-11-20,70397989,Sole,"Pushaun has been the most helpful host ever! Meeting us at our arrival to hand us the keys as we arrived on a Saturday Morning and the market would not allow us to arrive right in front of the apartment.<br/>Pushaun has been in touch with us thoughout our stay to make sure we were fine, and indeed we were!<br/>The apartment is very nicely decorated, we stayed for 3 nights with 3 children who were very comfortable and slept perfectly.<br/><br/>Looking forward to our next visit in London"
27561753,354831686,2018-12-02,44002986,Roy,Very friendly and helpful host. Appreciated the drinks in the fridge :)
27561753,356979663,2018-12-09,41815880,Marie-Thérèse,"Great location , fabulous place"
27561753,359866676,2018-12-18,107309588,Faith,"Pushaun's home was perfect for our time in London.  It is perfectly located on Portabello road with easy access to the market, food vendors and the hustle and bustle of the market activities.  It was close to public transportation and an easy starting point.  The flat was perfect for our family of 5 and was large enough to offer plenty of room for privacy if need be.   Pushaun's communication was excellent. He answered questions and was very helpful in providing local suggestions and finding the flat.  I highly recommend Pushaun's flat and hope to return next time we are in London!"
27561753,360301849,2018-12-20,94966011,Nathalie,The host canceled this reservation 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
27561753,364803636,2018-12-31,69289741,JoEllen,"Wow, such a rip off. We spent way too much money to travel all the way to London with 2 kids on Christmas day to sadly walk into this completely decrepit apartment. The pictures were accurate but were obviously taken many years ago. We walked through a scary door filled with graffiti into a freezing dank smell. The wood floors sag and creak everywhere. The steep stairways were the worse with the wobbly and broken railing and the sinking wood boards. There was only one viable chair to sit in the living room. I've never seen a couch so beat up that the stuffing in the seat cushions were clumped into uncomfortable balls. I guess you could sit in the hard dining room chairs. But not the most comfortable place to watch TV from. There was one bathroom downstairs that is very old and worn. When choosing a place the bathroom is the most important room so this was a complete disappointment. The bedrooms upstairs were stark and felt like my college dorm room (actually that probably was nicer) The bathroom upstairs had been updated but obviously is not being taken care of. There is grime and mold on the floor tiles. Feel like I should have been paid to stay in that dump. So sad<br/><br/><br/><br/>to get a refund and were"
27561753,367164410,2019-01-04,41025721,Paul,"Great location, right in the heart of Portobello Rd with market stalls and quirky shops in abundance.  The flat is large and provided plenty of room for our family of five to stay, and get away from each other! There is a wide selection of restaurants, pubs, takeaways and supermarkets within a few minutes walk so its as convenient as it gets. Whilst there is no parking at the property,  the Westfield carpark is 20 min easy walk away and very inexpensive."
27561753,400966399,2019-01-13,2345457,Jean,"The place is bohemian, spacious in a great location with lovey view on Portobello Road. Pushaun was a great and the most welcoming host who took considerable time to make sure we had all what we needed and more. It was a perfect stay."
27561753,419561104,2019-03-04,82617193,Deirdre,"This property is quirky and in keeping with the feel of Notting hill...from the entrance hall to the shower room at the top of the house,it was immaculately clean.Beds were super comfy.<br/>We did need eye masks to screen the light from the sky lights in every room,this was only by preference tho.Couldnt fault the property,would stay again..."
27561753,431010853,2019-03-31,185913362,Monique,"Great location!!! Spacious appartment in the middle of notting hill in a vibrant neighbourhood. Pushaun welcomed us, showed us the appartment and there was champagne waiting for us upon arrival. Very friendly.<br/>The only thing we did not like was the check out procedure. When we booked we were asked what time the check out was. We answered 1100 o clock, the last aivalable moment. The day before check out we got a message which said they just realized we were leaving at 1100 o clock and we had to make sure to be gone by that time cause the cleaners would come shortly after 11 o clock. That morning we were having breakfast near the appartment and we returned 10.45 to lock the door and take the suitcases. Turned out I got a voicemail: we did not check out properly and the cleaners left and could not enter te building. I even got a message about late check outs and how they frustrate the cleaning process. I did not like it all since it was not even 11 o clock so we were just in time! After that we were in a hurry and not very comfortable. We could not find the drop box for the keys and our message where to find it remained unreplied. <br/>Bottom line: Pushaun is very friendly and welcoming but it seems like the organisation behind him ""the support team"" just made a mistake by planning the cleaning staff to early. Nice stay but the check out could be done different"
27561753,433925603,2019-04-07,26242402,Grace,Very stylish space. Great location on buzzy Portobello Road. Perfect base for a weekend getaway. Pushaun was very easy to communicate with.
27561753,437255490,2019-04-14,161285091,Shirley,"The location of this apartment is second to none.  The buzz around the area is great and you really feel like you are a local.  Pushaun is a generous host - attentive and kind.  The apartment is very stylish and suited our 4 x person stay. Its close to a Tesco Metro and Farmers Market and many, many top restaurants. If you want to people watch the most famous market in the world from your 1st floor window, this is the place for you.  Its also just a few mins walk from the nearest Tube (Ladbroke Grove) and multiple bus routes."
27570612,324521436,2018-09-17,19056582,Dimosthenis,My worst Air Bnb experience ever. Nobody was waiting for my in the house. I had to find the Keys my self in the middle of the street. <br/>No linens.<br/>Communication was very slow. Zero flexibility. <br/><br/>Disappointed
27570612,351323580,2018-11-22,25834237,Timothy,"My stay at Elise's place was good.  It is very conveniently located to Belsize Park Station.  Responses were quick, and everything in the apartment was functional and clean."

27570612,426556442,2019-03-21,113430770,David,Great value and location that apartment for London. I would certainly stay there again.
27570612,445863715,2019-04-30,3676798,Heidi,"The flat was just as advertised: quiet, clean and a quick walk to the tube station. Good communication and quick responses from host.  Had a great stay!"
27570612,448533986,2019-05-05,172993411,Louise,Wonderful flat and great location. Elise and her team were very communicative and helpful.
27570612,449772924,2019-05-07,5205892,Ara,Difficult to find the address. The actual address was given a few days prior to the arrival but it would have been better if it was informed right after the payment was made or even before booking. Address system in UK is different from other countries so there should be a considerate instruction about the address for first-time visitors.<br/><br/>And check out time was informed wrong. I never made any change for check out time but Elise team kept sending me different check out time (originally 11am but informed as 9am) and I wasted time to fix the cleaning schedule. It was very upsetting when they even tried to charge  me the cleaning cancel fee. <br/><br/>My first time airbnb in London and won’t use it again in London until I get over with this experience.
27570612,458677071,2019-05-26,4420770,Bonnie,Difficult to find. Cold & sterile - not really set up for living. Bring your own coffee/tea. No kettle for hot water. Wifi is spotty.
27570612,463485676,2019-06-03,137260978,Jake,Lovely place and really well positioned!
27570612,468799791,2019-06-13,8725206,Lisa,"This flat was beautiful, clean, and very well located. Elsie was very communicative and responsive. My only critique is that the check-in, specifically locating the property's keys, was somewhat complicated. Instructions are clear, but the location of the keys is far from the property. Make sure you plan ahead to give yourself a bit of time during daylight hours to find them. Other than that, a lovely space."
27570612,473343178,2019-06-21,199683556,Johannes,"The flat is located in a very quiet neighbourhood, yet it is only 4 minutes from the nearest Tube station and cafés, restaurants, grocery stores… The place itself is very spacious and everything's kept in very good order. The kitchen is very convenient and has all you need to make your own food. It's a delight to sleep in that flat: from comfy-ness of the bed, to total silence at night, it's a great way to unwind after a long day in bustling London. Five stars on every count."
27570612,477985940,2019-06-29,14983046,Kate,"Great spot, my favorite part of London. Easy enough to get to and pretty quiet. Lovely block of flats within a very short walk of anything you might need!"
27570612,484720332,2019-07-09,25971643,Jesse,My husband and I really enjoyed having this spot in London to retreat back to. Being situated so close to the underground and having so many little shops and convenience stores open late was handy. <br/>We would definitely stay again!
27570612,486159661,2019-07-12,109424742,Keith,"I’m a regular traveller from Australia <br/>Loved the place.  Great location to the tube, city, dining, shops.  <br/><br/>Great for a close walk to spend a day in nature Hampstead Heath Park and visit the stately home within<br/><br/>I loved it "
27570612,493413867,2019-07-22,59177854,Or,"The flat has a prime location in a quiet place just off the high street and tube station.<br/>It's in mint condition and kept sparkling clean. Bed is comfy but you might want to ask for extra pillows. Shower has a formidable water pressure, a feature that, as everyone who spent more than a night in a London flat knows, shouldn't be taken for granted.<br/>We will surely return to this little gem."
27570612,518896025,2019-08-27,53298545,Daniel,I loved staying at Elise's place. It's clean and quiet and provided the perfect environment for getting deep work done during the day and relaxing in the evenings. I'll definitely come back if I can.
27570612,530835379,2019-09-16,49898391,Trevor,"The flat is lovely, bright, and spacious. The location is excellent, leafy and green; away from the hustle and bustle, but easy to get anywhere in the city quickly. Top marks for the VERY comfortable bed, with black out shades. That's not something you find in AirBnb's often enough. There were issues with getting the keys for check in. I was given the wrong information. But, the management company was very responsive and things got sorted out quickly. The one downside was a complete lack of storage. Fine if you're only staying for a couple of days, but I was there for three weeks. Living out of my suitcase was simply not an option. There is a large closet, but it is locked and for the owner's use only. I ended up buying a cheap wardrobe from Argos for about 35 pounds. I left it there. Hopefully they will keep it for future guests, or get something else more suitable. Otherwise, I very much enjoyed my stay."
27570612,533992259,2019-09-22,36355907,John,"Overall this is a great apartment, just as described. Lots of space, very clean, big windows, functional kitchen, fantastic water pressure, comfortable bed. The location is really nice as well; close by several big parks, lots of good restaurants, and some cool old buildings and halls. Our only (very small) complaint is that finding the keys and getting into the apartment took a bit longer than expected. You just need to read over the instructions carefully. But this is minor stuff. We had a terrific time here and would not hesitate to recommend."
27570612,540949115,2019-10-04,82048226,Mats,"Excellent place in a beautiful part of town.  Peaceful, bright and clean.   A short walk from great cafes, pubs, and shops.  Very convenient for tube, and for Hampstead Heath."
27570612,544172280,2019-10-09,57331816,Emily,"Elise's place was a fabulous location in the heart of Belsize Park. Such a beautiful neighborhood to stay in and very well connected. It was a great place to stay. Elise left a list of local recommendations that was very helpful. The flat was clean, and had everything I needed for my stay. Thanks!"

Den var lite lyhörd men inget som störde. Bra område med en superbra matbutik! <br/><br/>Vi hade dock problem vid in-checkningen, instruktionerna var felaktiga och otydliga. Tog 1 h för oss att komma innanför dörren. <br/><br/>Annars är vi super nöjda med våra dagar här! Skulle rekommendera!"

The agents response to any requests could have been better, but they do reply promptly. There kitchen is equipped with the basics, but it's not possible to cook anything elaborate"

It is large and it has a nice view on the back garden. The house is located in a residential area and there are local shops and restaurants around, including some organic ones. I will use it again"
27598487,320868826,2018-09-09,203185445,David,"Really nice people to deal with, very helpful in organising our entry. It’s very cheap price so you get what you pay for but the smell of cat urine was a bit intense."
27598487,335202821,2018-10-11,30328355,Deborah,I have been with my family and my little dog almost for a month in Alesia and Duccio house. The time there it's been nice and it is a pleasure have met someone like them. They are helpful for everything and theyou really love pets. My dog as well loved the house and the garden. Thank you Duccio and Alesia
27598487,346092037,2018-11-07,113241442,Baptiste,"It's a bit confusing as it was among the cheapest airbnb in London but it was a bit sketchy. Not so comfortable, ordered but everything was sticky...<br/>Missing basic tool, such as bed lamp or trashin the room. I had to wash every pan or plate I use. Lots of awkward moments, unable to assess how many airbnb room were rented. Or how many people were living therest the time of my stay. I won't go into every detailss but I had a cheap airbnb in Berlin few years ago I would sell this room as a product."
27598487,346336370,2018-11-08,52227646,Saïkou,"Great stay in a this bright and big room in Hackney. This is a great location yet the house is located in a quiet area, the garden is cozy and inviting and Alesia and Duccio are really nice and accommodating people. I’ll book again."

It was quiet and there was no noise from outside so I got a good night’s sleep, essential after an 11 hours plane trip. Alessia was very helpful and communicative. All in all, an enjoyable experience and I would stay here again."
27598487,361396163,2018-12-23,47542172,Sobia,"Alesia’s place is about a 13 min walk from Hackney Central station . It is excellent in terms of location. It’s so easy to get around. The room is very clean and has all the necessary items you would need. They even put a mirror in the room upon me requesting so which was very accommodating, and this was much appreciated. Alesia and Duccio are very quick in answering any questions you may have and their communication skills are fantastic. I had an excellent stay and would happily stay again . Thanks again guys x"
27598487,363267882,2018-12-28,23710889,Conan,The room was basic but had everything required. The hosts were attentive to messages and accomodating. The house has heating although I don’t think it’s listed. The room smelled a bit funky. The downstairs shower was tiny. For the price it was fair.
27598487,405555006,2019-01-27,77055417,Lorenzo,"Duccio helped me when i was in need and Alesia is been really kind, thank you very much for everything"
27598487,414947961,2019-02-21,53147080,Sharon,"Alesia is super nice. We arrived two hours earlier than normal check in time. She was already in the house waiting for us. She is really helpful during our stay. BTW, her cat is cute."
27598487,428587399,2019-03-25,20715778,Michael,"Alesia & Duccio are friendly, considerate hosts and very prompt with communication."
27598487,432573017,2019-04-04,83348320,Jacob,"The stay was mostly fine. I am not in the habit of leaving bad reviews. The place is cheap and simple and fine for younger travelers looking for a deal. I wasnt particularly happy there, but it wasnt dangerous or shady. I have used airbnb a great deal over the last year of traveling, and this is one of the few places I wouldn't return to."
27598487,432941277,2019-04-05,24059916,Veronica,"Alessia house is large and clean and the bedroom is at the back of the house, facing the garden and has very fresh an crispy linen and a comfortable mattress. <br/><br/>Alessia was kind and she also showed me the area where the free tea and coffee for guests are, which was a plus because I did not have to buy it in the morning. <br/><br/>The location is good and for what I paid it was really very good value for money."
27598487,435431074,2019-04-10,58517342,Luke,"Cheap, basic, clean accommodation. Good, helpful communication  from the owners. No problems."
27598487,437160895,2019-04-14,54884395,Amy,"My boyfriend and I stayed one night in Alesia's place. The location was good, communication was good and self check in was easy.. The apartment was a lot older than I expected from the photos and the floor in the room was quite old and dirty. For the price we paid it was okay."
27598487,439652685,2019-04-19,186242089,Laura,Fantastic communication with Alesia
27598487,451270906,2019-05-11,140402197,Alex,For what you pay this was above my expectations. Alessia was very polite and was helpful on the check in process. The building looks a little tired but everything is clean and operational. It is great value and would recommend!
27598487,452965458,2019-05-14,195265201,S,"Alesia's place is excellent value for money.  She is a very caring, communicative and welcoming host.  The mattress in my room was delightfully comfortable,  which more than made up for the somewhat unclean floor.  Although she does not provide breakfast,  the stock for common use kept on the kitchen table worked just as fine.   Moreover,  she offers her kitchen to guests,  so no problem there.<br/>I am pleased with my stay at Alesia's and will certainly consider booking with her again."
27598487,455161082,2019-05-19,119283136,Richard,"I didn't meet Alesia but I did meet Duccio, who was very personable. I was staying here for the Hackney Half Marathon and as such this was an ideal place to stay as Hackney Marshes was only a short walk away. I would recommend this place for anyone with business in East London."
27598487,462817064,2019-06-02,191843104,Sam,Thanks for having us. Perfect location and great value for money.
27598487,465222148,2019-06-07,43057613,Frank,"Kleine nette kamer die aan de verwachting voldeed. <br/>Attente en eerlijke verhuurster, de door mij vergeten bankpasjes ed werden keurig bewaard en afgegeven."
27598487,472353465,2019-06-19,157553407,Mery,There’s a great place to stay. You can met other flashmates and Alessia is very kind. She told me tips about how living in London and I’m pretty grateful ^^
27598487,477016607,2019-06-27,162567,Jacob,"Whilst the property is definitely on its last legs, it is clean, functional and thus good value!"
27598487,485151558,2019-07-10,29977938,Jan,"The place is good value for money, however, there are certain drawbacks: the idea you get from the photos do not exactly correspond with reality, the kitchen area (cupboards and fridge) is disorderly and dirty, the bathroom is ok even though it could be cleaner, the entire house smells funny and the floors are creaky and mouldy. The positives are good communication with the hosts, working facilities, and an interesting location."
27598487,489185388,2019-07-16,75244315,Zsolt,"Room was big and spacious. Bus stops and the Overground station are in 10 minute walking time. The oven was really dirty, the kitchen and the bathroom needs some cleaning, but overall we had a great time in London. Fair enough room for the price!"
27598487,492214278,2019-07-21,119206085,David,"Great location, great communication, self check in. The cats are amazing and a comfortable bed! If I'm London i'll stay again!"
27598487,496215384,2019-07-27,26617915,Greta,"I really loved the position of the house. The room was spacious and quiet except the bin collection at early morning (my room was dacing the Road). The house Is really connfortable and there Is a Little outside space with One beautiful cat and her two wonderful kittens. In the house there are other rooms for renting. I didn't meet the host personally, but Alesia was really precise and Kind with my check in. Good price/quality ."
27598487,498236641,2019-07-29,177799759,Thomas,The room was very good as the location. Alesia and Duccio was very nice. We had some troubles during our trip and they did everything they could to help us. It was a very good experience. <br/>Thank you very mutch
27598487,503585423,2019-08-06,205430394,Nina,"Great hosts, really communicative and kind. Thank you for your hospitality :)"
27598487,512184700,2019-08-18,13679833,Sabrina,"If you love cats you have to go there :) the place is nearby some awesome shops, pubs and other restaurants. Great for public transportation!"
27598487,513855230,2019-08-20,112488632,Nik,"The house is on a quiet street and near shops, pubs, restaurants etc. It is tatty outside and in. It's needs a clean and decoration. There are cats and one is obviously male!  That said my room was big and clean and private if basic and stark.  The bathroom and shower is in need of some attention but the shower worked and there was plenty of hot water; towel and soap provided. There is a lounge and a kitchen. Tea and biscuits are provided and there is a fridge. Alesia was quick to communicate and was responsive and helpful. There is on street parking but it is pay and display. All in all it was OK and probs worth the money for a private room in that there London."
27598487,518841009,2019-08-27,106225927,Aleksandra,"Alesia was a wonderful host, but the accommodation was a bit too dirty for me."
27598487,525217882,2019-09-07,32595049,Maria,Alesia is very responsive and always there for any questions. Her explanations are very clear and I managed to find the house easily. She has also kindly agreed to look for my missing oyster card once I left the property. The property is a good 15 minutes walk to the overground station and 5 minutes walk to the bus station. It is run down and could use some work. I have also experienced an unpleasant smell not so much in my room but in the bathroom and the entrance hallway.
27598487,527270175,2019-09-10,769488,Tanja,"Alesia's bedroom is very large and extremely quiet, it is clean and there is a large desk which for me was perfect because I had to do some work on my laptop. The house is located in a residential area of Hackney with many restaurants nearby. Everything was clean and Alesia responds very fast to messages. She sent me all the information I needed. I loved that self-check-in was possible. The price is extremely good value for money."
27598487,530090264,2019-09-15,258502016,James,"Really great location, price and venue. The bed is comfy and the room is clean and spacious. The hosts were really responsive and helpful. Would definitely recommend"
27598487,531708474,2019-09-18,281166948,Nishat,"The location was perfect for me, but i would have expected the room to be a bit better than how it was. Wasn’t really impressed with the flooring, some bits of the wood was loose, the blinds wouldn’t fully close. Most things in the room, just seemed really old and broken and really rusty. Did not like the bathroom, the tank was really weird, was hard to flush. Same with the flooring just felt as if it was all really dirty."
27598487,536778749,2019-09-27,96980142,Luca,"The place is as shown in the pictures, cozy, quiet, and large enough to put your stuff even if you travel with heavy or bulky baggage. There is a desk where you can work with a seat. The bed is comfortable."
27598487,542387699,2019-10-06,35053297,Tom,"Hard to find cheap accommodation in London so for the price Alesia's place is good to get your head down for the night. Location was great, bed was comfortable and free on-street parking at the weekend but the house is pretty run down and dated so although it may be cleaned regularly, it is hard to tell and the shower/bathroom wasn't great. The bedroom and some other areas just need a lick of paint and would then look a lot better and there is a lingering smell in the hallways. On the whole, you get what you pay for but Alesia was very good with communicating with us and helpful"
27598487,543783440,2019-10-08,6814165,Alper,"Ideal location, very well communication.<br/>Thank you Alesia!"
27598487,544883817,2019-10-11,37175297,Sebastian,It was good. <br/>Thank you.
27598487,547504121,2019-10-15,57715043,David,Exactly what it promises to be. Good value and located within walking distance to Hackney and Homerton.
27598487,548248712,2019-10-17,276277645,Ludovica,The hoise is well located confortable and easy to be  . I felt home thanks
27598487,559622049,2019-11-04,135543212,Hilary,Good value for money. Clean and tidy. Would stay here again. Thanks Alesia!
27598487,563300804,2019-11-12,275457613,Mikaela,Nice room and easy check in/communication
27598487,564204321,2019-11-15,114482460,Timothée Marshall,"Une réactivité incroyable! Alesia m’a permis de me loger à la dernière seconde!<br/>La chambre ainsi que les espaces commun était niquel! Et Alesia est plein de petites attentions! <br/>On se sent comme chez sois!<br/><br/>Le quartier est légèrement excentré de Londres centre se qui le rend calme, jolie et tout de même vivant!<br/><br/>Il y a 2 stations a moins d’un quart d’heure de marche qui vous mènes aux grandes ligne.<br/><br/>Encore merci pour ce séjour!"
27598487,565359818,2019-11-17,121234067,Claire,"Decent, basic room. Comfy bed was a bonus."
27598487,566414239,2019-11-19,74505346,Martin,Very convenient & central place - exactly what I was looking for.  Quick and helpful replies and very comfortable.
27598487,575799236,2019-12-11,313104813,Semira,Alesia is amazing host and the house is very nice place and good location
27598487,578948869,2019-12-19,314643518,Chelsea,"In good walking distance to the train station, I went into London every day! Alesia respected that I like to do my own thing, but was still available if I needed advice on the area. Great for the price, warm bed and good wifi connection! Thankyou!!"
27598487,587630135,2020-01-03,92010078,Alain,"L'appartement était confortable, mais l'hôte s'est montrée désagréable au moment du départ. Alors que nous avions libéré la chambre à l'heure prévue, nous sommes restés encore un peu dans la cuisine, ce qui a fortement mécontenté l'hôte. Elle a prétendu, à tort, que d'autres personnes attendaient pour rentrer."
27598487,600713673,2020-02-02,1607111,Damian,Place is a bit rough around the edges but it’s a cheap place to stay.
27598487,605401030,2020-02-14,63901514,Alexander,The flat was exactly as described. Alesia was very helpful and willing to work with my on my date adjustments.
27598487,612353830,2020-02-29,127513697,Arno,"Bon rapport qualité prix, assez calme"
27598487,615162276,2020-03-07,121899134,Mary,Very basic but overall perfect for our needs. Great host and good communication
27598487,616283412,2020-03-09,240295030,Carolina,Fast check in and out. Quiet zone. Confy bed. Old house in a bad conservation shape. The photos don't show exacly how the room really is.
27598487,617197755,2020-03-12,323664236,Monika,"All what I expected, thanks for hospitality"

27598487,637749183,2020-07-13,70504615,Asad,"It's great value for money. You wont get many places at this price in the region. But the photos dont entirely do it justice. The equipment and the building itself are a bit past their age i would say. If you are here for a short term on budget or if you are gonna come just to fall dead asleep at night and spend most of the time outside, it's great. Otherwise, you may wanna spend bit more."
27598487,646945681,2020-08-05,127058175,Lech,"The big prToblem is that the host brings some stoned, drunk guys and they drink and have a row. Alesia, I paid for this room and I should be quiet, and you and your friend are having brawls and fights, it's an absolute scandal, and I do not accept it, I also like to drink a beer, but I did not insult anyone or make any fights.I am disturbed by the behavior of the host and his guest, it is not acceptable"
27598487,654621370,2020-08-22,240891727,Duccio,"This room was booked for one of my friends who was in the area. Her feedback is ""Large and clean bedroom, check in was very easy, I arrived late at night and when I left in the morning nobody was there, the house is quiet and clean and the bedroom is on the back and I slept really well and it was also very good value for money!"""
27598487,656335040,2020-08-25,232259901,Darryl,"Perfect stay, I will be back again!"
27598487,657403738,2020-08-28,342988713,Chabahn,"I do recommend this location to stay. Alesia very friendly, kind and helpful"
27598487,669548775,2020-09-30,34919318,Denise,This is an old house but very good value for London.  Alessia is always on hand to help and answer questions.  I could be private and quiet in my room but also appreciated an interesting chat in the garden with guests from all over the globe.  I liked the atmosphere as it was very relaxed.
27598487,669823036,2020-10-01,232259901,Darryl,Always my preferred place to stay when in London and always works perfect.<br/>Thank Alesia for your help.
27598487,670935975,2020-10-04,237607988,Tabassum,"Accommodating host , were ok inspite of late check in. <br/>Duccio was very quick with his responses! <br/>Thanks"

27598487,705037127,2020-10-30,3397817,Joe,"can't argue for the money, but probably wouldn't stay there again. kittens were cute, but the neglected common areas, issues sorting access due to not having a key, made it a satisfactory stay at best,"
27598487,716753939,2020-12-20,200748522,Usman,"double room for this price is excellent value, hosts are good too, great communication"

27598487,720849247,2021-01-02,96306911,Randeep,Very nice and spacious room with large desk and plenty of room for working and relaxing.
27598487,737894831,2021-03-10,34919318,Denise,Alessa is a kindly host.  The space is homely and pleasant.  It is an old house so it is not luxurious but it is excellent value...especially for London.
27598487,743496920,2021-03-29,23023276,Sarah,Alexia’s place is very handy and central and alesia was very understanding and helpful

27598487,761427246,2021-05-23,65168141,Esther,"Really basic cheap place for short stays. Good size room with a big desk, but if your plan is to be able to use the kitchen and you care about the cleaning this might not be your place. I stayed long and I did not cook because the kitchen was not clean. I just used the microwave after cleaning it. The place needs a general deep cleaning everywhere."
27598487,766145218,2021-06-04,34919318,Denise,Alessia's place is ideal for the budget traveller.  Comfortable rooms...nobody bothers you.  Not luxurious but excellent value for London.
27598487,767690832,2021-06-07,48621182,Joseph,"good location, its not a nice place for someone who is looking for a clean place. <br/>kitchen and garden especially were really messy/dirty.<br/>The room is nice and neighborhood is perfect."
27598487,425925762918590456,2021-08-10,34919318,Denise,I am a regular at this airbnb.   It suits me perfectly...excellent value for money...near shops and train station...private...everyone is polite and doing their own thing.

27598487,481716262112024406,2021-10-26,34919318,Denise,As I always say....this house is excellent value for London....basic but private and usually the other guests are quiet and respectful.

27672320,437454605575465412,2021-08-26,4930191,Barny,Robert's place is a great way to get a flavour of one of the more interesting pockets of London. This is a part of London that most tourists won't venture to - but they will be missing out on what the younger creative people are doing these days.<br/>The apartment is cutting edge modern with all the toys like climate control and integrated sound system etc. Robert's style is the perfect compliment the  surroundings and as he actually lives there rather than just runs it as a business.  It is what Airbnb does best - gives you a sense of what's it like to live in an area.
27672320,501224102640700871,2021-11-22,13868599,Cath,A fantastic space in  the up and coming area of Hackney Wick. Much cooler and stylish than staying in a hotel. Robert was a great communicator and we would be more than happy to return.
27672320,505636967855191956,2021-11-28,160709110,Michal,"Robbie was absolutely amazing! He was great at communicating everything I needed to know and was really easy to get a hold of. The flat was gorgeous, super clean and had everything we needed. Would definitely come back and would 100% recommend staying here!"
27672320,510747511069997231,2021-12-05,45019745,Katy,A fantastic place to stay with a wonderful host in the coolest part of London <br/><br/>You won’t be disappointed!
27699063,325022134,2018-09-18,149197535,Liesl,"Extremely quick responses and accurate information communicated.  Easy to find with good transport links close by.<br/>Room bigger than expected and pleasingly decorated.  Clean shared spaces.<br/>A warm, friendly and welcoming host."
27699063,327796439,2018-09-24,11770723,Adnan,"Paul and Alex are so kind hosts. They make you feel as you are home. They will give you all information and suggestions you need. Place is so nice, quite, close to the city. I would really recommend it for sure and next visit will be also there for sure."

Room was very clean with all the necessities, had full access to the kitchen and great tips about things to do around. They are verre attentive and super friendly. Truly great stay in London."
27699063,333451513,2018-10-07,8907690,Ted,"a great stay in very central location - super convenient and great value - Paul and Alex are lovely hosts, super-friendly, chatty and fun to hang out with - the perfect London experience, definitely recommend!"
27699063,336312681,2018-10-14,169675947,Corinna,Beautiful place really close to jubilee line perfect to travel to the city center and in the same time enjoying the quietness of a cozy neighborhood. Paul is really kind and very helpful with his information about the city. Next time I would choose the same.
27699063,338772758,2018-10-20,70283962,Christos,Thank you Paul and Alex for your great hospitality. Very helpful people when needed. I highly recommend it  to everyone who wants  to visit London and feel like home!

He has very personal touches, and even got my sister and I tulips for international women’s day :) His place is quiet yet a two minute walk to the tube (and some amazing chocolate croissants in the local grocery store),  30 mins (via the Jubilee line) to Buckingham Palace, less than an hour to Heathrow airport. Would definitely recommend!"

27699063,474716920,2019-06-23,5774622,Laura,We really had a great time in London and at Paul's place. The apartment is centered in a really nice living area and very close to Sainsburys and the tube station. That way it was really easy and convenient to go to the city center. Paul always responded very quickly and he and his partner were really kind and helpful. The flat offered everything we needed and we thought it was really sweet we got some candy as a welcoming. Also the kitchen had all the equipment needed and there was coffee and tea for us as well. Really great and thanks a lot again for the great time!
27699063,477518032,2019-06-28,49873859,Julien-Jack,Paul is very keen to help and reactive. The apartment is really close to the subway and convenient. Recommend it!

He provided lots of local tips as well. The living space is cozy. The location is close to the Tube (Jubilee line). I really enjoyed my stay at Paul's place and would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in London.
27699063,498078482,2019-07-29,31669003,Hubert,"Paul is a friendly host who was always helpful. His place is really nice, close to the tube station, on a quiet street. I can recommend his place to others travellers."

27699063,573192754,2019-12-05,4727944,Helen,"Paul is amazing. He is full of helpful tips and knows his way around London, which he is more than happy to share about.  Additionally, I got sick, and he did all he could to take care of me. There was tea, ginger, and soup. Also, there are quite a few steps in a spiral staircase up to the apartment, but he carried our luggage upstairs. The location is great: very close to the subway station on the Jubilee line. One thing to note: there is no lock on the door. This was not a problem at all for us: Paul is very respectful. We will definitely come back and highly recommend his place."
27699063,574449895,2019-12-08,38709883,(Email hidden by Airbnb),"A wonderful space, very large bedroom, great kitchen facilities, good water pressure, incredibly generous, knowledgeable, warm host in Paul"

He was very helpful with all the tips and queries we had regarding London, local shops, tourist places etc.<br/>Room is a bit small for 2 people, as we both had  7-8 bags. <br/><br/>But overall a good experience."

27699063,609149838,2020-02-22,37219317,Aida,Paul's house is beautiful and cozy and his hospitality is great! The house is very close to transports (tube station on Jubilee line) and it's in a quiet street. The room was lovely and peaceful. Paul provides everything you need and he is always available! I highly suggest his place.
27699063,612326800,2020-02-29,123383113,Danny,"The appartement is clean, its near the center or London. Paul is a nice person, having conversation with him is simple. I recommend 200%."

27744116,329688061,2018-09-29,39574847,Craig,"Beautiful apartment in a fantastic area, our favourite place in London. Could ask for a better location. Minutes walk from Hampstead and Hampstead Heath stations and the many shops and restaurants. Small block with considerate residents. The road is a bit noisy but the bedroom is at the back and really quiet. Thanks again for letting us stay!"
27744116,335796166,2018-10-13,650912,Cameron,"Great apartment in a fantastic location in Hampstead. Check in was quick and easy, and the host was very quick to respond to any questions I had. Recommended."
27744116,341202748,2018-10-26,3829945,Brenda,"We had several issues with this property , first of which is that it is managed by an agency who doesn't know much at all about the property and is not responsive. We were contacted 2 days prior to our arrival to be offered some deliver vouchers as the hob was not working. We refused and asked to kindly try to fix it, but had no reply, so we assumed they would work on it. When we arrived at the property it was in a terrible condition: rubbish bags in the living room, dust everywhere. It had not been cleaned for several days. Plus the agent knew nothing about the hob. it took a good 40 minutes to him to find a cleaner, who quickly and badly cleaned the flat in a couple of hours, but she left no welcome pack (which was in the description of the flat), left old butter and milk in the fridge from the previous clients, and there was no coffee at all (not even something to make it with). We had to eat out the all time, as we were told only 2 days later that the hob had to be replaced, and that was not going to happen while we were there. host maker then offered a portable stove the day before we left, when we asked for a partial refund of our stay, given the huge problem of not being able to use the kitchen and the fact that they didn't fully explain that the hob would NEVER work, which at that point we didn't even use. There are works in the stairs (changing carpet and painting) which are not mentioned in the description but are actually quite annoying considering the dust and smell, While those are still happening, I think the price of the property should be reduced. If you are staying in this property I would advise that you check all the above with host maker before making your reservation. We will not book this flat again. Despite being a nice flat, it is overpriced and no one wants to spend the holidays dealing with agencies and airbnb (which was also completely useless)."
27744116,342116228,2018-10-28,179011553,Lojan,"Great area, close to shops and amazing value for money"
27744116,344991701,2018-11-04,6045333,Ilenia,"If you're looking to stay in this airbnb for a a night or two, I'd say it's a great solution. Located in the beautiful neighborhood of Hampstead, very close to public transportation. If you are looking to stay for a longer period of time, like we did, then this is definitely not the place. One of the perks of staying in airbnbs is that you get to cook for yourself and here even tho they had pot and pans, you could clearly see that nobody lives in this apartment (it's just used as an airbnb rental) hence there wasn't even a tea bag, nor the essentials like olive oil and that's just to give an example, with the exception of salt - there was salt. But worst, everyday when coming back to the airbnb, we'd be welcomed by TONS of wasps. Wasps everywhere in the living room / kitchen area, bathroom making it impossible to relax nor to enjoy the time spent there."
27744116,346337303,2018-11-08,121240266,Cézanne,Lovely airy apartment in top location
27744116,349980210,2018-11-18,15492567,Katrina,"Amazing stay! This lovely apartment just up Hampstead High Street is the perfect place to stay when visiting London. The place was sparkling clean, beds were comfy and it had everything you could need including great wifi, TV pots and pans etc. The issues with the hob have been fixed and we cooked a number of evenings, we also enjoyed exploring the amazing restaurants nearby! Would highly recommend Arielle's place to anyone and I hope to return soon."

27744116,426205540,2019-03-20,1658804,Maxim,Absolutely fantastic apartment in a beautiful area. My new go-to favourite place to stay in London.
27744116,428931829,2019-03-26,70287,Kelly,"This flat was lovely as advertised. Perfect location in Hampstead, and a light bright airy very well decorated comfortable flat.<br/>Though on a busy street, I found the front room even quiet. The bedroom was nicely private and tucked away to the rear and very quiet as well - perfectly cozy for sleeping.<br/>The flat is managed by Hostmaker, who were very accommodating, professional and thorough.<br/>Would highly recommend!"
27744116,429957058,2019-03-29,166958831,Xantha,Very cosy and nice looking apartment on a perfect location in the nicest part of Hampstead. A very comfortable bed and nice and clean bathroom. We will definitely book this again!!
27744116,432238781,2019-04-03,5669131,Michael,"We had a most wonderful stay at Arielle's place. The apartment is in walking distance to our favourite park in London, Hampstead Heath. It is also close to either Hampstead Station via Northern Line or Hampstead Heath served by the Overground and such well connected. Lots of nice shops and cafes closeby. The living room and kitchen open to Rosslyn Hill Street, which is quite busy and hence relatively loud, however the sleeping room is at the rear and absolutely quiet. The kitchen is well equipped with all you can ask for. The only thing that bothered us was the carpet in the living room: it was a modern, colorful and nice-to-look-at carpet, however at the end of our stay we had lints from the carpet everywhere as it loses its threads unfortunately. Nonetheless, we definitely gonna come back and can highly recommend Arielle's place."
27744116,437258219,2019-04-14,20138840,Jenny,"Lovely apartment in a beautiful location. The bedroom is small but with great wardrobe space; the bed is super comfy (queen size). Great shower and luxurious towels. The kitchen is well stocked - but there are such good cafes, restaurants and bars nearby or for take aways - you don’t need to cook! The lounge windows are single sash - meaning it can feel chilly if the temperatures outside are low. The flat is great for a couple traveling - would not necessarily recommend for a small baby as the bedroom is too small to add a cot."
27744116,448628667,2019-05-05,70220548,Eberhard,Appartement und Lage sind sehr gut. Professionelle Vertretung der Gastgeberin schlecht erreichbar und schlampig für den Preis(fehlende Beleuchtung in Küche und teils Bad).
27744116,453961074,2019-05-17,11024479,Patricia,"Arielle’s flat is perfect for a couple. Location was excellent- close to Tube, shops, restaurants and Hamstead Heath."
27744116,466550800,2019-06-09,17182418,Jane,"Wonderful location close to Hamstead Station on a quaint high street with lots of shopping, cafes and restaurants. The apartment was clean with good sheets and towels and a good, firm bed.  Cooking would not be convenient here, the kitchen is small, the knives are dull. But for wine and French press coffee, you're all set.  A teapot would be a nice addition. We wished the appointments had been more thoughtful and sophisticated. It's a utilitarian space with too many, junky nick-nacks when it could be less cluttered and more elegant with just a few alterations."
27744116,478081591,2019-06-29,3379978,Ellen,"The location of the flat is terrific and the flat itself is lovely. But please note that this is one of those Hostmaker apartments where the linens are amazing but the apartment itself is a bit beat up. Lots of little things broken or unkept (e.g., lights out in kitchen and bathroom, large picture frame on floor behind the couch, lamp broken, rug shedding, etc.). In general, we have had several similar experiences with Hostmaker. In the future, I'll be sure to check if the apartment is being managed by them."
27744116,485240014,2019-07-10,82197841,Ashley,"Arielle’s flat is in a great location, with buses and the tube right on your doorstep. Hampstead shops and cafes are fantastic, many great pubs are in walking distance and the heath is just five minutes away. The apartment is very stylish and was a good size for three of us. Being on the first floor meant we felt safe and could sleep with windows open for lovely night-time breezes. We miss London already and hope to stay at Arielle’s again."
27744116,495557482,2019-07-26,165473059,Martin,"It was amazing! We loved the place. Super clean. Thanks Arielle, I hope we can come back!"
27744116,502988444,2019-08-05,99577510,Mark,"This place proved to be a perfect wee place to get over jet-lag after 36 hours of travel! Comfy bed, good shower, washing machine/dryer, couch, smart TV and a small kitchen. The location is also great, with lots of cute pubs and places to eat, good transport links and, of course, Hampstead Heath. The place is pretty small (the photos make it look bigger) but it’s perfect if you’re flying solo or a couple. Any more would be a squeeze I reckon. The place is also a little dilapidated but good value overall. The only gripe would be check in, which was a pain, as the key pick up location is a 20 minute walk from the property. Completely unnecessary, in my opinion, since there is a lock box on site for check out! Overall, for what I needed, it was fine and I’d consider staying there again."
27744116,509309415,2019-08-14,37200148,Lee,Good location - close to Hampstead and Belsize Park tubes.

Dieser Stadtteil von London ist wirklich sehr angenehm und eine schöne Umgebung, um sich von anstrengenden Sightseeing-Touren zu erholen! Es gibt jede Menge nette Cafés, Pubs, Restaurants usw.. Die Wohnung ist wie auf den Bildern beschrieben, total sauber und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Wir kommen gerne wieder!"
27744116,536327232,2019-09-26,1298855,Anya,We loved our three-week stay at Ariel's. The apartment was clean and well furnished. The bed was super comfortable and linens were high quality. The water pressure was nice. We had everything we needed to cook. <br/>The neighborhood is absolutely lovely and there were many options for restaurants and shops. Several parks are a walking distance away. Also the proximity to several modes of transport within a short walk is a huge plus. <br/>We hope to come back.
27744116,539501668,2019-10-01,48794491,Greig,Beautiful apartment right in the heart of Hampstead. Well appointed and the perfect size for a couple of people . I will hope to stay there again soon.

27744116,576391882,2019-12-13,1146052,Lauren,"Arielle's flat is in a perfect location in the heart of Hampstead. It's run by an Airbnb rental agency which has some pluses (professionally cleaned, laundered linen and towels, coffee and tea provided) and downsides (no one responded to questions I posed over Airbnb messages, including whether we could extend our reservation a night, for weeks). If you need anything: call the agency directly and they will try to resolve it quickly. Two other notes: We found the water in the shower warm, not hot, during our stay even though water from kitchen sink was very hot. I also found the key to the front door very tricky and called agency when I was unable to open it."

27744116,718270343,2020-12-26,220426513,Rachel,"Lovely area, easy to find and easy to stay. Don’t expect too much from the kitchen, it really needs updating at some point so it can be as nice as the rest of the flat. Lovely high ceilings and a nice space in general, you can’t beat the location though it’s perfect. The bed is very firm but I didn’t mind that at all, overall it was comfortable and pleasant, bit overpriced though."
27744116,721902021,2021-01-04,371929708,Mike,"We had no heating and were forced to play around with the boiler under instruction from a support team to no avail, before the penny dropped and it was recognised that a plumber was required. The place is in desperate need of some TLC. The kitchen area is depressing, the cupboards are sad. Great location, tragically sad that no one checked before we got there that the heating was not working. Finally during covid a better place for picking up the keys which involves less contact in crowded places would be wise."
27744116,723993367,2021-01-13,26315256,Alan,very good location and lovely inside. very cold in winter time but it would be a great place in the summer

27744116,728364935,2021-02-01,54480756,Susan,Lovely well located stylish flat.
27744116,729483772,2021-02-07,11798945,Jamie,"Sadly, I cannot recommend this place. The location is amazing; however, I couldn't rate it highly because there were  so many broken and dirty things in the flat that made our stay feel unwelcome. The kitchen is practically unusable and we had to rewash everything before use. We had to order Deliveroo each night because it was dirty and not functional. I think the oven was made before I was born. Not what you'd expect, based on the photos. Also, the heating and internet were a mess. Bedroom was boiling and living room was freezing and internet kept crashing. One redeeming feature was lovely, upgraded TV!!! If the owner would just invest in a few nice things, this property would be amazing. Has potential, but people expect nice bedding and clean kitchens. Sorry Arielle :-("
27744116,758339426,2021-05-15,119018948,Karin,"The place looks just like the photos. Super cute, adorable and bohemian. Amazing location and so quiet! I’d def stay again. <br/>I saw some reviews about heating now working but it worked great and everything was seamless.  Kitchen was pretty small and a bit dated so if you are looking to cook loads, maybe not the best place for you. But why cook when so many good restaurants around. Will def stay again."

27744116,505679948666091695,2021-11-28,16113796,Dwi,"The neighborhood is beautiful , the apartment is beautiful and was great for a short stay. I felt it was clean and comfortable! I wish I could have stayed longer. Communication was super clear and easy, which I appreciated. <br/><br/>Instructions and house guide was professionally made and that’s always super appreciated! <br/><br/>If you’re on the three network, take note there is absolutely no cell reception so when I tried to call the host for help, I wasn’t able to and had to go downstairs to ask a neighbor for help. <br/><br/>Just note there’s no access to the mailbox so for those that need to have the day 2 PCR test mailed in, I mailed it to my friend instead and went by to pick it up."
27808094,314043474,2018-08-26,90548187,Waleed,"Big apartment with two bedrooms, big living room, big enough kitchen, balcony and private parking area.<br/>There was a Sunday bazaar in the neighborhood and we like it it was a little bit crowded at thet time but it’s good with a great deals.<br/>Nick meet us personally and he told us everything we need to know about his place, answer our questions about some interesting places we can go to and told us that he is ready for any help related to his place.<br/>Negative point about his apartment that you will hear the noise of trains and you will not sleep because of that."
27808094,315250728,2018-08-28,210999884,George,"Lovely apartment, felt super safe and views were wicked. Bed was super comfy and a variety of pillow types to choose from, really caters to those who are picky with their pillows like me! Great sound system for the TV and BBC iPlayer Netflix etc all on there. Had a problem with getting the microwave to turn on even though it was plugged in in all the right places, and there was no saucepan to cook with which resulted in having to make do with a small metal pot with no handles (not sure what it was) but everything else was as described and a really pleasant stay, thank you Nick great host!!"
27808094,318691883,2018-09-04,145654891,Dominik,Nick was a very good host. He answered very fast and was helpful if we needed anything.<br/><br/>The flat itself was exactly what we expected. Shoreditch is a very nice district especially for young people because there are many bars and restaurants around.<br/><br/>I would recommend this flat (and host) to everyone doing a trip to London!

The appartment is 10' walk from Bethnal Green and Liverpool Street, really easy for any connection.  It's a really nice place, bright and clean. The beds are very comfortable. The communication with Nick was really easy with (Hidden by Airbnb) . I will definitely come back at this place next time I'll come to London!"

27808094,427243179,2019-03-23,100813839,Jacobo,"I've had a great stay at Nicks place. Really big flat with spacious rooms, everything was clean, tidy and really cosy! Although it's next to the train station the place is very calm and silent, and the views are fantastic. Thank you very much!"

27808094,442407402,2019-04-23,49111377,Caitlyn,"Nick’s apartment was in a great location for us (three 30 year olds). We were a 5 minute walk to public transport which made traveling into center city London very easy. Shoreditch is a great neighborhood and we didn’t expect to spend so much time there, but we are so glad we did. (We compared it to Brooklyn, NY. Very hip and a great night life.) <br/><br/>Nick was an excellent host as he was very quick to respond to our messages and he was flexible with our check out, which was incredibly helpful due to our departure flight time. <br/><br/>Yes, trains run by every few minutes,  but if the windows are closed, you can barely hear them. We are from NYC, so this was a non-issue. <br/><br/>The space itself is a great size and we would definitely stay here again if we came back to London. (We hope to!)"
27808094,447898207,2019-05-04,19321641,Chika,Nick's apartment was comforatable to stay. It is clean and wide enough. We appreciated it that he was flexible about our check-out. He responded to our request promptly. Shoreditch is an exciting place to stay. I definitely recommend Nick's apartment.

27808094,468818057,2019-06-13,17058595,May,"It is a spacious, clean and neat place. We could see how much he cares about the place and how much effort he put to keep it in its best. Though you can hear the sound of the trains passing by, it did not really bother me and my friend as it has quite good soundproof. All we had to do was just close the window, and we slept like a baby. I wouldn’t say it has a very convenient location, compared to other accommodations I have experienced, but it still has a quite convenient location enough for you to enjoy Shoreditch area."
27808094,471273623,2019-06-17,70833237,Bryce,It was a really great stay! We loved the area and the apartment. Host was helpful and good at responding. Would stay again!

27849322,314773651,2018-08-27,159317018,Mila,Айша хороший и интересный человек. Но возможно нужно починить канализацию в доме и прочистить стоки в трубах. Жильё вполне пригодно для временного прибытия. Я благодарна Айше за приют в ее доме. 
27849322,325269053,2018-09-19,210718427,Hana,"Ayesha's home was my first Airbnb experience and Ayesha was the best host one could possibly wish for. She picked us up with her car the day we came and made us feel at home from the beginning. <br/><br/>She provided everything we needed, toilet paper, kitchen utensils, etc. and on several occasions also her great company, conversation and laughs. <br/><br/>Her home is in a very quite and good neighbourhood, you can go out at night with no worries. There is a park close by that you can have a jog in, Aldi and Tesco express is also near. Anerley station is 10 minute walk from her house and you can be in the city centre in 30 minutes. <br/><br/>Thank you so much Ayesha!"

About a 40 minute trip into the center, it’s great if you are planning on staying out in the city all day. The room was basic but the bed was comfortable and made a great base. Ayesha was very friendly and made me feel comfortable in her home. Would recommend if you are in London for a short stay."

Jessica is a very good host and the instructions were clear. It was also easy to travel from and to the apartment. <br/><br/>Thank you Jessica!

Right from booking Jessica was extremely helpful and very accommodating, especially as we were traveling with our two boys, one of whom is a baby. The apartment is very clean, spacious and modern. It is definitely like a home from home and has everything you need for either a short or long stay. It's in an absolutely fantastic location, with easy access via the underground to central London and ten minutes walking to The tower of London. We will definitely be booking with Jessica again, when we're back in London!"

28252200,436554968,2019-04-13,69416287,Tabitha,From the moment I booked Jessica’s place she was messaging me. She gave me great tips and genuinely cared about what we had planned. <br/>When we arrived at the place I was a bit confused at first but then I remembered the note that Jessica had sent about the address confusion and we figured it out. We were on the 1st floor ( 2nd for American) so you are going to have to get your luggage up stairs and that was a pain but we managed.  Check-in instructions were very clear. The apartment was very clean and had all the little extras that we really enjoyed. I really enjoyed the towel warmer in the bathroom since it was freezing(at least to me)while we were there. The Bermondsey tube is about a 5 min walk which made it very convenient. I would definitely recommend Jessica’s place to anyone that is considering staying here. <br/>Perfect Place! Amazing Host!
28252200,443214232,2019-04-25,306251,Luca,"The apartment is very nice and cozy. It has enough space to fit 4 people (we were 2 adults and 2 children). Even the position is perfect to visit london, 5 minutes walk from the nearestundeground station and 10 minutes walk from london bridge.<br/>The apartment was very clean and we easily found it at our arrival.<br/>Jess have been suportive and replied quickly to all our questions."

Jessica was a very tentative and friendly host and was a pleasure to deal with. All instructions were very clear and straight forward and her apartment was perfect for our needs. I’d have no hesitation staying here again.

28252200,518346690,2019-08-26,264592177,Wynn,"Not far from the tube or a few small pubs! That’s a plus. <br/><br/>Some of the apartment residents, however, loudly party throughout the evening. That’s a minus."
28252200,525181660,2019-09-07,264352706,Kathy,"This was a very good location, easy to get to tube and walk to may locations. We really felt like we part of a neighbourhood. Jessica was responsive to any questions. The apartment was spotless yet cozy. Everything we needed was there."
28252200,535457690,2019-09-24,39433548,Jillian,Our stay at Jessica's place was great! Close to transportation and a 10-15 minute walk to a large selection of restaurants. We really enjoyed our time here!
28252200,552318699,2019-10-21,264021718,Silvia,"We really enjoyed our stay. The apartment is very close to the next underground station and to a Tesco supermarket. Lots of small and interesting shops and places to eat, too. The apartment felt like home. It was cozy, clean and had everything we needed for our stay. Communication with Jessica was always very pleasant and helpful."
28252200,571498431,2019-12-01,313384065,Sarah,"Thank you so much for giving us a late check in when we were let down by another host. Everything was fantastic, close to the tube, attractions and restaurants/bars. Your place was spotless and comfortable."

28252200,586974495,2020-01-02,139588484,Florent,"Jessica’s apartment is very well located (15 min walking distance from Tower Bridge, 6 min from subway), perfectly clean and convenient. However, neighbourhood is noisy so best to avoid coming with little kids.<br/>Jessica is a perfect host, always available and listening.<br/>That was a very great stay!"
28252200,593891816,2020-01-17,171652443,Kelley,"The place was very clean and the location was excellent. Jessica was an excellent communicator and always got back to us within minutes when we had a question. I would not hesitate to go back again. Also, the proximity to a tube station was huge. The only minuses that might affect some but not all groups — for people with movement challenges the shower/tub might be difficult. It is very high up with nothing to grab. My not-limber parents in their 70s would struggle for example. Also, there is only comfortable seating for two. The couch can hold three if you line up in a row, but groups with three adults will probably find one of them spending the evening on a kitchen chair. But back to the positives. The shower head was great, lots of water, and the hot water supply was excellent. A super abundance of towels. We never ran out of hot water and towels. And it was really great having a washer/dryer, which allowed us to pack fewer clothes. The neighborhood felt safe. We would definitely come back to Jessica,a place."
28252200,600686913,2020-02-02,60219397,Pratteek,The stay was very well located and had excellent communications for where to arrive and how to get to the location. It was a great retreat for my weekend in London

28252200,607648359,2020-02-18,66850192,Hiromi,"Jessica was a very kind host. The place was located in the great area for restaurants and cafe. Also, there was a nice exhibition at Fashion and textile museum which was just 10 minutes walk. Easy access to the central.  We very much enjoyed our short stay in London."

Heating worked great (impt when it’s cold out there), was grateful for the towel heaters, and the kitchenette was sufficient for us to heat up takeaways / whip up a quick breakfast / make lots of tea.

Gaden hvor lejligheden ligger er rigtig hyggelig og selve lejligheden var ren og praktisk indrettet med god plads på trods af de 5 sovepladser på relativ få kvm. Christine var virkelig hurtig til at svare på vores henvendelser og er i det hele taget utrolig serviceminded. Vi kan helt sikkert anbefale Christines lejlighed og håber at vi får mulighed for at komme retur en anden gang.

Everything you need (and more) for a stay is included. The flat decor is so impressive I’d even rather stay here than a hotel. <br/><br/>The flat is conveniently located 5-6 min walking form a train station that provides access to pretty much all the city. There’s a grocery shop close as well if you are cooking  as I did (I stayed for 1 full week). <br/><br/>There are main streets close by that have restaurants, bars and pubs. <br/><br/>Marike and Wolfgang were highly responsive before and during the stay, very helpful, provided good recommendations and super friendly. <br/><br/>They welcomed me in person, which was a really nice gesture. They provided a bottle of wine and sparkling flavored water for my stay and some other amenities that gave that extra something.  <br/><br/>In all my years using Airbnb, this is the best location I’ve ever stayed. <br/><br/>If you find the place available, book it right away. You won’t regret it. It really competes with a 5* hotel."
28832994,360625216,2018-12-21,41467250,Nicholas,"I stayed in Marike’s place for around two and a half months and I have to say, it was an excellent experience!<br/><br/>It is a stylish space, well located and absolutely spotless. The cleaner comes every week and now and again I returned to find little added extras such as fresh flowers replaced and even extra provisions in the fridge.<br/><br/>The flat is cool and functional. There isn’t a TV in the lounge but each bedroom has one. The cooker can also take a little getting used to but it’s fine once you get the hang of it.<br/><br/>Overall, Marike’s place was great and at the end, I actually felt sad to leave! Thoroughly recommended"
28832994,368855157,2019-01-08,32913179,Алексей,"Мы рекомендуем останавливаться в этой очень удобной и расположенной в очень прекрасном месте квартире. До станции метро 10-15 минут пешком , так же рядом расположен большой Супермаркет ( по дороге к метро). До центра города 20-30 минут на метро или такси.<br/>Очень тихое место. Спасибо огромное хозяевам за их гостеприимство."
28832994,417799392,2019-02-28,40412965,Fei,"Marike is a super host ever!!! We have a very pleasant and comfortable time in apartment. Welcome wine and champagne, snacks, cleaning every week and flowers every week. Super thoughtful!!!! The location is amazing, 10mins walk to tube, 13mins to Tesco extra. Do not hesitate if you are looking at this apartment, it just looks like what picture showing, and the high tech in house will definitely surprise you!"
28832994,434658954,2019-04-08,35787007,Christel,"Honestly, this place is amazing. Thoughtful through and through (everything you may need is there), high tech (including an Amazon Echo in every room, smart heating, a high tech fridge/freezer, washer, dryer, dishwasher that look brand new) and amazing decor (I took some tips for my new flat). It's exactly as described if not more."
28832994,437775259,2019-04-15,48980653,Cynthia,"Wolf and Marike’s flat is beautiful - more beautiful in person than the pictures posted.  My first thought upon entering is “This should be a AirB&B plus!”.  <br/><br/>Upon check in, we were greeted by Wolf.  He explained the special features of the flat and provided us with a welcome gift basket.  <br/><br/>For transportation, the flat is a 5 minute walk to the Overground and 15 minute walk to the Underground.  It is very close to cafes, eateries, and a Tesco.  <br/><br/>Communication with the hosts was fast.  They would reply within less than 5 minutes of my sent message. <br/><br/>We had a nice holiday in London. One of the main reasons why it was nice was due to the amazing flat and great hosts.  We plan to return to this flat in the future for our stay. <br/><br/>Also, AirB&B if you read any reviews, please make Marike and Wolfgang’s flat an AirB&B plus.  They are very deserving of this status."
28832994,444820587,2019-04-28,36818973,Lorraine,"The apartment is exactly as described - clean and comfortable, beautifully furnished.  It was an easy walk to the Overground.  Marike was a welcoming host.  She accommodated our slightly early arrival and made sure that everything was perfect for our stay."
28832994,465817897,2019-06-08,229212200,Melanie,"Marike is charming, quick to respond and had good recommendations for local spots.  Check-in was easy.  The flat is beautiful with many of the comforts of home.  It's located close to shops, pub, restaurants and transport."
28832994,481792664,2019-07-05,249635360,Jonathan,"If only every host was like Marike; if only every host had a home like Marike!<br/><br/>Her flat is super comfortable, convenient and stylish, all rolled into one. Right on top of public transport (Jubilee Line, Overground and Buses), it is easy to reach West End, City and Docklands locations.   The interior has a pronounced contemporary vibe and is packed full of delightful appliances and thoughtful touches to make your stay a true home away from home!   Marike has gone to a lot of trouble to invest in features that are far from standard in most hosts' places, while not wasting time and money on gimmicks that do not add value. <br/><br/>I really liked having Alexa in multiple rooms, along with a high-spec Smeg kitchen and comprehensive washer / dryer/ dishwasher solution.   The bathroom is great also, and time and effort has gone into building out a charming patio space to enjoy the warm, Summer weather.<br/><br/>As I said at the top of the review, what made my experience special was not just the place but also the host.  Marike is super responsive to her guests' needs and both communicative and friendly, without ever being too present.  She is also most considerate and always provided ample notice whenever she needed to come by the flat. <br/><br/>Disappointing stays require longer reviews, with objective details provided to substantiate remarks.  Since this experience is positive without exception, no more needs to be said.  Go enjoy!"
28832994,489292908,2019-07-16,120646147,Nicole,Great place! BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED! Super close to Surrey Keys overground and one stop to Canada Water on the Jubilee. Groceries are very near by as well. Lovely flat with great amenities.
28832994,498203259,2019-07-29,192352134,Asmaan,"If there was ever any hesitation about staying at this property, you should rest assured that you are going to get your money's worth and more. Marike's home is both a luxury and a comfort. It feels like a warm hug, but also a refined taste of London. The apartment is close to everything you could possible need.  Transit, shopping, coffee and food are all a short walk away, but you also get the quiet, serene peace away from the chaos of the city. The best of both words. The place was fully stocked with all the amenities we could possibly need, the fluffiest beds, high speed wifi and a TV for each room. They made leaving the home a bit difficult. The hosts were also so kind, sweet, and constantly communicating to make sure we had everything we need. I can't wait to come back to London and stay here."
28832994,538113684,2019-09-29,2043875,Alix,"Marike's place is amazing ! I would definitely recommend booking the flat for short or long stays. It's very well equipped, stylish and greatly located. A cleaner takes care of the flat every week : you're getting the best hotel features with the nice feeling of being at home."
28832994,543764735,2019-10-08,40162403,Sharon,"I must say the stay in Marike’s lovely home was one of the best choices of my London traveling. The home-interior, deco and facilities meets all the needs we need when traveling. location is quiet perfect to most of the attraction in ZONE 1-2 , safe , quite and very local. Also ，Marike is always in quick response and help us manage a early check-in. Will highly recommend to other travelers!"
28832994,567639129,2019-11-23,134024487,Liu,"This is the warmest apartment that we ever stay! Surprised by the welcoming wine & snacks, in addition to the great hospitality that Marike does. Highly recommend & we will definitely comeback again in March:)"
28832994,574538034,2019-12-08,253796490,Miru,"Marike and Wolf are such wonderful hosts. I can’t put into words how wonderful my stay was at their place. Everything was great, even better than the photos! Don’t hesitate to book!"
28832994,589646424,2020-01-06,156529501,Johan,"I can humbly say that my stay at Marike's was outstanding in every way...<br/><br/>The house was without question as described and the welcome was fantastic and more than a welcomed relief after a long haul flight to London with everything in the fridge and kitchen so one could just ""truly"" kick back and relax.. <br/><br/>The house was exceptionally clean and neat and the layout and decor far exceeds most expectations and is very much to quote my daughter ""just divine decor and I want a place just like this"" so were all impressed and could honestly say a ""home from home"" and the bar has been set very high for others... <br/><br/>The location is ideal for getting to all the main attractions and tourist sights by the train and bus and when I had meetings in Paddington which is at the other side of the city was only 45 minutes door to door even in rush hour so connectivity to everywhere is very frequent, convenient and simple. <br/><br/>Being a homely guy and like cooking, the kitchen set-up is without question very well done and well equipped where I cooked a FULL Christmas lunch for the family.  The garden is superb in layout and comfort, and even though it was a cold London winter one could easily imagine spring and summer sitting out with a nice glass of wine in the very private setting.<br/><br/>There is just too much one can say about this house and none that I could write would or could do it the full justice it deserves, but one thing I do know is that I would stay here in a heart beat and not have a second thought of booking again in the future or recommending to anyone to stay at this accommodation... ""its just fantastic""..."

28832994,624514264,2020-05-11,93862659,Hilary,"Marike's hospitality was just as fabulous as the place itself. From high-end amenities, to a great location and outstanding cleanliness, I will stay here every time I pass through London going forward. It is definitely an (Hidden by Airbnb) ready AirBNB. She had fresh flowers and treats waiting on arrival. The garden with the firepit was lovely. The bedding was like a cloud. Honestly... I cannot say enough great things about the place and Marike!!"
28832994,750943324,2021-04-22,62461246,Zara,"Super host, indeed. Marike is very helpful and thoughtful. Very cute flat and my fav part was that someone would come to clean every weekend."
28832994,763634574,2021-05-29,90743521,Hugh,"Great flat, almost like a hotel with a really cool outdoor area. Marijke and Wolfgang couldn’t have been more accommodating or helpful, with a late check in, a pizza and beers on arrival and again a late check out. I would thoroughly recommend this place."

28832994,489715369551242870,2021-11-06,337654653,Егор,"Marike and Wolfgang are great hosts: there was everything we needed at the flat and more (beer and soft drinks), all the stuff in the flat is fancy-ish and high quality. There's some nice outdoor space although we never used it. Whenever we had any problems, hosts were ready to help and  quickly come by if needed.<br/><br/>A minor issue was that you can hear quite well what's happening in your neighbor's room and especially the sound of water turning on (boiler buzzes when heating up, I guess). So whenever our sleeping schedules didn't match (or there were some people in the night by the windows), we had to use earplugs. <br/><br/>Though I did have to pay over 300 pounds extra for the bedding + mattress protector + pillow I've damaged with stains (to be fair, I was able to receive most of the damaged bedding to keep), I don't think it should influence the rating much as it was a rather unusual situation and the stay was nice in general."
28838441,450515142938914530,2021-09-13,134926300,Corde,"Beautiful apartment, Great location, can’t recommend highly enough. Check in was slightly late due to unforeseen circumstances. Overall extremely happy, thank you."
28838441,502724408261296212,2021-11-24,7324112,Julian,Great place! Loved it. 100% recommended
29298347,365380783,2019-01-01,109363117,Jason,"The most outstanding element were the hosts, who allowed a smooth check-in with a large time window and almost instant communication via the messaging app. A nice written message was waiting upon arrival which was a welcome personal touch, along with little treats to help us meet the new year in style!<br/>London is a massive city, obviously, so where the apartment may not look central to the city center on a map, it still is within a small walk (5-10 min) to a very good regular transport connection.<br/>This apartment is the hosts personal apartment, so expect to stay in London in a way the locals would (c.f. the apartments that can be found on here 365 days a year only for Airbnb use)."
29298347,585939640,2020-01-01,314240685,Rachel,"We spent 2 nights at Chris’s place and everything was just perfect. The airbnb is well located in a quiet neighborhood and very near the bus stop. Being given the detailed guidance, we could easily check in on our arrival. The apartment is very clean and nicely decorated. The kitchen is fully equipped and there are also card games and board games available. Champagne for the new year celebration and chocolate are ready on the table for us. Chris also left a welcome note and recommended us some Asian restaurants in the surrounding area. I can say that this is the best airbnb experience we have ever had. Thank you for hosting us at the New Year’s time. We would definitely love to book our stay at your place again when we visit London next time."
29298347,409973963844190621,2021-07-19,41690368,Anas,"I don’t have words to describe how amazing Chris and his girlfriend were. We did a family trip in July with my wife and 3 girls (Under 9) for a family wedding. Traveling with little kids is stressful to begin with but once you add the pandemic, the restrictions, the quarantine, the COVID testing, and a wedding the stress level sky rockets. <br/><br/>However, Chris and Indi went above an beyond. He communicated with me for almost a month prior asking any questions I had. He was in touch with me when I landed and was there to receive us when we got to his place. Walked us around the apartment and made sure we had settled in before he left. Indi went above and beyond and had games and arts/crafts for my girls which my girls immediately took to after a 16+ journey. <br/><br/>The place was amazing!!! It was walking distance to shop, restaurants, grocery stores, and the tube station and the assigned parking space was a God sent as we had a car. The apartment comfortable can sleep 6 people and seemed like it was newly renovated. Although the place was contemporary it completely felt like our home away from home. We stayed for 10 days and that Chris’s place was home base as we drove all over London to meet family. Throughout our stay Chris kept in touch and answered any questions we had. <br/><br/>We ended up having an amazing trip despite the hassle of traveling in a pandemic with kids and it would not have been possible without Chris and Indi. Highly highly HIGHLY recommend Chris as a host and this location if you want to be close to central London."

29327571,353304689,2018-11-27,2513790,Violeta,"Nice apartment, good very central location. <br/>Minus points for agency that rents out apartment for making the checkin so complicated (keys in a lockbox at another location as the apartment, sending youtube videos on how to fix water problem instead of calling - the link to the video was btw not accessible)."
29327571,354279934,2018-12-01,44198818,Alex,"One of the best AirBnBs I've stayed at in London! Great location, safe, quiet, warm and cozy. Easily walkable all around Canary Wharf. Would definitely stay here again!"

29327571,357748719,2018-12-11,155017760,Matthew,"We stayed at Alina's apartment for 6 nights . I'm sure this apartment is nice to stay in normally, however we had issues with the hot water. After contacting the host about this issue, responses were delayed, unhelpful, and ultimately the issue was not resolved. Overall, it was a clean apartment in a nice location, however we found check in to be a bit of a treasure hunt and communication from the host to be sub-par at best."
29327571,360636763,2018-12-21,44821449,Chris,Amazing location for local work and travel

29327571,413307650,2019-02-17,139382807,Katia,"What an amazing apartment!  <br/>I stayed in Alina's place for 6 weeks between Jan and Feb 2019. I am so glad I chose her place! It had everything I needed in order to feel at home. The flat is stylish and very cosy - just like in the the pictures! The bed is comfortable and the linen and towels are of high quality. The place was sparkling clean. <br/>It benefits from a gorgeous large smart TV where you can watch Netflix etc, however there are no normal TV channels. <br/>Although the flat is close to the DLR train line, it isn't noisy when you have the windows closed. Very good noise cancelling. But if you want to have your window open at night, prepare to hear the trains run as well as the constructions works going on at night in Canary Wharf. This isn't a problem when all windows are closed.<br/>The flat isn't looking into the Canary Wharf estate, but into an internal courtyard, but a lot of light comes in on sunny days which is really really nice!<br/>The kitchen is fully equipped for anyone who may want to cook a meal.<br/>The bathroom also has anything you may need (from hair/ body products to earbuds).<br/><br/>The location of the apartment has got to be the BEST thing about this place! It's just by the foot bridge in Canary Wharf, so only a 2 min walk from the DLR and Jubilee tube station, and also dangerously close to all those amazing shops in the Canary Wharf Shopping Malls. There is a Tesco just around the corner, but also a Marks and Spencers foodhall and Waitrose not too far. And plenty of restaurants and fast food chains around.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this place more! It's been absolutely amazing for me!"
29327571,416225222,2019-02-24,59905129,Abhigya,The place was amazingly clean and the instructions were very easy to follow with regards to the check in.
29327571,418163158,2019-03-01,62618847,Sheena,Very clean place in a convenient location for Canary Wharf. Quiet property. Note the TV doesn’t have an aerial so is only useable if you plug in a laptop or DVD player.

Elle répond à tous les besoins rapidement.<br/>J’ai aimé la proximité du DLR, du métro et des boutiques et restaurants. <br/>L’appartement est très complet dans la cuisine ce qui est très rare.<br/>Merci beaucoup pour le séjour"
29327571,431996035,2019-04-02,3693956,Liz,"I spent some time at Alina’s place while having my kitchen done. It was incredibly convenient for the tube and shops of Canary Wharf, and the flat was cosy and peaceful and well equipped. Check in was easy and twice while I was staying there, I had queries which were immediately and helpfully answered. thanks!"

29327571,594864200,2020-01-19,275364122,Constantin,"The place was great. The apartment is very well located and clean, communication was fast, check-in instructions were pretty clear. I would recommend."
29327571,608652882,2020-02-21,27760967,Matt,"I stayed at Alina’s place for two weeks whilst on a work trip based in Canary Wharf. The apartment was well located from the main part of Canary Wharf just across the footbridge. Checkin was relatively straightforward and the instructions clear. The apartment was as described, and a far better option than a local hotel. My only feedback would be that the TV should be hooked up to both local channels and also the internet to enable NetFlix etc. Otherwise, good place and would stay here again."

29358893,365371662,2019-01-01,115363836,Perry,This is an excellent location for a large family or group of friends looking to have a great house to spend time together and see the city of London. It's a 3-minute walk from a bus stop and another 5-7 minute bus ride to a sub station. The house had great amenities and was very comfortable!

You can come and go on your own really easily. There are nearby grocery stores that were open even on Christmas day and you can cook. You can walk to Hyde Park, it will take you about 1h 20 minutes but is doable. Overall, great place to stay."
29775612,366810179,2019-01-03,27037312,Lucrezia,Comfortable bedroom and bathroom! Kam very helpful to help and kind.

29775612,459278741,2019-05-27,235590947,Lilly,Kam is very very nice. We mostly stayed out of each other’s way but when we ran into each other he’d always ask how my day has gone and if there was anything I needed. Nearest tube is about a 10 minute walk which isn’t too bad. WiFi didn’t reach the room very well though.
29775612,460912926,2019-05-30,56139295,Roberto,"Kam is an awesome host, the house has a really nice location and has everything to have very good stay. <br/>Transportation restaurants and pubs near by."

29775612,514931829,2019-08-22,58639964,Dimo,It's a nice place. I needed 50 minutes to get to the super center. The neighborhood is safe and quiet.

29775612,543265412,2019-10-07,17085322,André,All good. Thanks.
29775612,575118913,2019-12-09,104388275,Priyank,Did not enjoy this Airbnb experience.<br/>Kam greeted during arrival. He also did not respond to messages until arrival. The location is 20 mins walk from the closest Underground. The heating was timed and I did not have the access to switch it on/off. The bathroom could have been cleaner. There were no towels on welcome which I feel is basic especially when there is a service and cleaning fee. A request to extend the check out by 1 hour was also refused.
29775612,594927780,2020-01-19,22970618,Catherine,Kam was very welcoming and helped out with good tips for travel and food in the area. A good space to myself with the bedroom being upstairs away from the living area and other bedrooms. I enjoyed my stay.
29775612,596931529,2020-01-24,37359667,Chido,"The room and area were very nice. Kam was very responsive and friendly, solving any issue l had. I had a feeling that the little comforts were missing, for example the bed did not have a mattress protector, and had a thin bed sheet.  Sometimes basic amenities would run out in the shared areas. These are easy things to change so I wouldn’t hesitate to book this stay."
29775612,600834711,2020-02-02,290960638,Scott,"Just what I needed for my weekend in Acton. Nicely situated close to tubes and overgrounds into central London, too. Lovely friendly welcome from the host who offered me local tips for shopping and trains and so on"
29775612,462146493415154421,2021-09-29,89385938,Rodrigo,"Nice place to stay, great location, clean. Kam was very welcoming and friendly. He helped us multiple times."

They were great hosts and responded very quickly for the small need we had. I would highly recommend staying with them!!"

29797899,425890679,2019-03-19,16177,Noele,"I had an 18 hour layover and didn’t realize it until I got to London.  I reached out to Tony & Min at around 5 or 5:30pm and they responded right away and let me check in immediately. When I got to their place, Min walked me to the guest house since she saw me walking up. (There is a keypad for a self check-in though).<br/><br/>The apt was awesome! It was much bigger than I thought it would be and everything was super modern.<br/><br/>Min even offered to get me dinner since there wasn’t anything within walking distance, but I just ordered in and she delivered it to me when it arrived.<br/><br/>Great stay - it was perfect for my overnight layover. I’d highly recommend staying with Tony and Min!"

The space was as advertised, and although the sofa bed was a little stiff, there was plenty of extra blankets to pad the bed and make it comfortable. The hosts are great! They were super quick to respond to our messages. Min also checked in with us personally and made us feel taken care of. We definitely appreciated the thoughtfulness of the hosts to provide snacks and bits for breakfast as well. Great stay overall!"
29797899,429534874,2019-03-28,48699294,Brenda,"WOW! If you book with Tony and Min, you will not be disappointed. Literally felt like home. They add many nice touches like snacks, coffee, tea, cereal. You have a tv with all the smart apps and Wii. Lots of closet space with full length mirrors. I stayed for a long layover at Heathrow and it only took 10-15 with public transport which wasn’t bad at all. There’s this place called pheasant inn that you should checkout that’s nearby this neighborhood for food and drinks. Tony and Min’s place was so convenient and delivered above expected. Thank you!"

We stayed after watching the Rugby in Twickenham, Tony and Min were very flexible with check in times so we did not feel the need to rush back. Fantastic accommodation, would definitely recommend."
29797899,449684856,2019-05-07,12335492,Elizabeth,"Large, spacious, clean and lovely. Beautifully appointed with everything you could want or need: towels, bedding, free breakfast (cereals + pastries + biscuits), a selection of teas, coffee, underfloor heating, and a fully private entrance. Also, it's not a studio, it's a one bed flat! Enormous kitchen, living room/bedroom which is nice and roomy, and big bathroom. Free on-street parking at the front, and self-checkin which made it very easy. Also, super fast internet of 50MB (10MB up). Tony and Min are lovely and super responsive. We had an immigration appointment at the VFS Indian visa centre and it was only a 5 minute walk. And only a £20 Uber ride from Heathrow (10 minutes). Would definitely stay again! Thank you so much."

29797899,454066029,2019-05-17,43863440,Stefania,"Tony & Min were great hosts! I ended up coming in late due to a train delay and they were very helpful and made sure I knew exactly how to get in and that I could contact them if I had any issues. The space is wonderful-I felt like I had lots of privacy and it was very comfortable-they had a map of the transportation system as well which was also helpful! In addition, they were flexible with checkout times which was very kind of them and also allowed me to get my travel plans in order before having to go! wish I could have stayed longer and highly recommend this place if you want easy access to the airport and to transportation around the city!"

29797899,462819485,2019-06-02,260451859,Lisa,"The only reason we’re giving 5 stars, is because we can’t give it 6! <br/><br/>This was our first Airbnb experience and it’s going to be a hard act to follow. <br/><br/>Full marks from start to finish. Easy to find, easy to park, easy to check in and when we opened the front door, all three of us went WOW!  We were very impressed and happy. <br/><br/>The whole self contained apartment was spacious, very clean and well maintained with all the things you’d hope for;<br/><br/>Widescreen Internet TV with Netflix etc..<br/>Apple TV<br/>Wii <br/>Very fast Wi-fi <br/>Big firm comfy bed<br/>Big sofa bed<br/>Smoke/Fire Alarms <br/>Climate Control <br/><br/>Massive floor to ceiling cupboards (mirrored doors)<br/><br/>Large corner shower in beautifully tiled big bathroom<br/> <br/>Modern kitchen with great appliances that all work. <br/><br/>Fridge freezer <br/>Toaster <br/>Microwave <br/>Heater<br/>Even a washing machine & tumble dryer (at an extra cost).<br/><br/>But the most impressive quality to this Airbnb, were our hosts.<br/><br/>They really couldn’t do enough for us. The amount of provisions they stocked the apartment with was amazing. <br/><br/>All essentials and then some were catered for, we really didn’t need to buy much for the two days we were there. <br/><br/>We happen to have a son around the same age as our hosts, they played all afternoon, then he joined them for tea. I’m not saying they can do this for everyone, it’s just to give you some idea of how welcoming they are. <br/><br/>Needless to say, we highly recommend staying here and will be back again & again."
29797899,463519494,2019-06-03,202904795,Clare,This was the perfect place for an early flight out of Heathrow! The guesthouse is so nice and tucked away with a lot of privacy. The train is close enough to the property or the airport is a short Uber ride away. I would definitely stay again!
29797899,463857132,2019-06-04,234186987,Jacqueline,"I was surprised at how amazing Tony/Min's place is. Not only was it a very private and exclusive area, with our own kitchen, bathroom and a large bedroom, the place was very modern and sparkling clean. Check in was easy, with very clear instructions and they made sure to send it to me beforehand. The only complain we have is that we didn't get to stay longer than one night! It was such a comfortable place that me and my husband didn't want to leave at all. We needed the place because we're planning to head to Heathrow Airport early in the morning, and the bus stop for the free shuttle to it is literally one minute walk away, which is fantastic! I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants a private and comfortable Airbnb for short or long stay."
29797899,465745033,2019-06-08,2080420,Wayne And This Is Ann,"Min was outstanding, the accommodation was above our expectations, perfect location for  a few days stop over. Easy access to and from the airport and London. We had a special request and Min made it available with pleasure."

29797899,469840203,2019-06-15,12335492,Elizabeth,"This was our second stay at Min's and it was just as perfect and delightful as before. The wifi is super fast and stable, the smart TV is great, the kitchen and range of tea, biscuits, milk and breakfast items was fantastic, the security is great, and it is walking distance to the Indian VFS office which is perfect. Also an easy drive from Heathrow with free on-street parking. It has radiant heat in the floor (amazing) and is a big private dwelling with its own entrance. Also, the bed is *amazing*, so comfy! Last but most certainly not least, Min is absolutely lovely and made us feel very welcome. Thank you so much, we look forward to staying with you again!"
29797899,470554192,2019-06-16,236121815,Kathleen,"If you are looking for a place near Heathrow, I cannot recommend this Air B&B enough. A quick ride from Heathrow, this is a large, well-appointed, clean stand alone place. Min and Tony were great. We just spent the past 3 weeks in Air B&Bs in Ireland and England and this was hands down in our top 2."
29797899,471855738,2019-06-18,39052660,Polly,A really comfortable place with great amenities that made our overnight stay before an early flight hassle free.

We also were so thankful for the kitchen space where snacks and breakfast were provided. It was conveniently located very close to bus stop which was a few minutesaway from train station. It was very convenient for us to get to Heathrow. I would highly recommend this space. Great value for money.

It even has a sitting area and full kitchen.  <br/><br/>I would not recommend getting there after dark the first night because it is a bit difficult to find.    Our girl bet driver dropped us on the wrong street entirely.  Fortunately some kind souls helped us find the correct house."
29797899,490952884,2019-07-19,102864300,Mariyah,Very nice people.
29797899,491536935,2019-07-20,23031798,Si Yi,It’s the best place near the airport if you have a late arrival or early departure flight. So spacious and clean.
29797899,493996185,2019-07-23,130925959,Shannon,"Tony and Min’s apartment was the perfect place to spend the night before heading out to Heathrow Airport in the morning! The space was huge, and they provided everything one could think of, even food for breakfast in the morning!"
29797899,494357411,2019-07-24,256664987,Ang,The best place to stay ever!
29797899,496300797,2019-07-27,17908443,Teresa,"Tony & Min's studio was exactly right for myself, husband & daughter as we only required one overnight stay to go to a 30th celebration. Great that there was parking right outside & all the instructions were very clear to locate & enter the studio. Both my husband & daughter feel uncomfortable staying in other people's places & having to make conversation - so again this was perfect with its own private access & entry by code. The studio was very spacious; it was clean & provided the essentials + biscuits & croissants  Perfect!"
29797899,498792384,2019-07-30,758038,Latchezara,"Clean,  close to airport location. Great communication!  Thank you."

29797899,501324923,2019-08-03,106976425,Thinh,"We only stay for a night since we were heading out early in the morning. Thank goodness we decide to stay closed by since we almost missed our flight! <br/><br/>This place is huge and spacious, could easily sleep 4-6! But it was just us too. Bathroom was large and even have a washer and dryer! The only bnb with this in our whole Europe tour! They even have sweet amenities in the kitchen, it was a life saver since we flew in so late and didn’t want to go out and find something to eat at 11pm. <br/><br/>Will def keep this place in mind next time we are in London!"
29797899,502204821,2019-08-04,252171849,Donald,Tony and Min’s place is fantastic. The space is much larger and more welcoming than expected. There are plenty of extra towels and linens as well as a wide assortment of snacks to make you feel right at home. Close proximity to the airport is also really convenient for an early morning flight.
29797899,503027253,2019-08-05,282414728,Jayne,"Spacious, spotless and stylish. Lots of thoughtful extra touches. Everything you need and more for a break. Fantastic value for money. Don't waste money on a hotel, stay here!"
29797899,504249912,2019-08-07,253905170,Shayna,"Was private, clean, and all the amenities you would need for your stay. Instructions clear and easy to follow. However, we had a problem with finding the address. We did not have easy access to WiFi which interfered. When googling the address provided be sure to input the location with zone number included. We ended up on the other side of London at the same address but different zone. Learn from my mistake."
29797899,506086089,2019-08-10,124782263,Luz,"Super close to the airport, bus service is free to airport from the Airbnb. Everything was better than expected. I loved everything."

No stairs to get to property, and well off main road for a quiet peaceful night. Clear communication, fast responses and helpful check in with photos. Lovely touches like shampoo, shower gel, pastries and biscuits - made it feel really welcoming. Min popped round twice with things we hadn't brought for us to use. She was very helpful and felt I could text to ask for help if needed.  Very close to motorway and airport - free parking and 20min walk to tube station."

29797899,527605961,2019-09-11,73658895,Pat,This is a wonderful stay. Very roomy and sparkling clean. Quick response to all our questions and excellent directions from Heathrow. It was a nice touch to have a bowl of sweets and croissants for breakfast as well as milk and butter and jam in the fridge. <br/>Grateful that an electrical converter was supplied so we didn’t have to worry about bowing a fuse. <br/>We definitely will be back.
29797899,530699605,2019-09-16,26209736,Zhuo,"Location was very near to the airport with a free bus which helped us save on our travels . About an hour away from the central .

A bit hard to find though when we arrived late and it was dark. Easy to get to Heathrow with bus. Tony and Min are fantastic hosts, helping us with all our questions, on the spot."
29797899,536768961,2019-09-27,125132735,Maura,This place was perfect for one night lay over near Heathrow. Tony and Min were super helpful and went out of their way to hold on to our luggage when our flight was later than expected. The space was super clean and spacious.

29797899,541570276,2019-10-05,296060866,Hongkun,"What impressed me most is the cleanness and space of the room. It's surprisingly tidy and spacious compared to what's shown in the pics. Bed set, TV, fast internet,kitchen,working desk, snacks etc. I actually felt like living in my own place. The only drawback for me is the location, it takes about half an hour to walk to the underground network(Hounslow west & Hatton Cross). So, if you don't mind this walk range then this place is 9/10. Or you can take a bus from Hatton Cross to get to this place."
29797899,542192758,2019-10-06,150306234,Paul,Reasonably priced. Spotlessly clean. Ideally placed. Would recommend.
29797899,543684228,2019-10-08,176674213,Karla,We loved this place. Very spacious. Very clean. All necessary items included. Snacks and teas were a fun bonus. Close to the bus stop.

29797899,545377013,2019-10-12,201640056,Sky,"My family and myself have stayed at Tony/Mins' place for 2 nights. We were discovering London in the most tourist way. Host let us have an early check-in so we could explore London even earlier. Room was very tidy and well located, it's just a couple of minutes away from a bus stop. The price is reasonable. The thing that We appreciated the most was that our privacy wasn't disturbed, it felt just like a home away from home. Hosts were very helpful with every inquiry and questions that we had. I would definitely recommend this place, as my family and myself enjoyed ourself by staying at Tony/Mins'."
29797899,546212907,2019-10-13,286413942,James,The place was great to stay at. Very close to the airport and a bus stop around the corner which helped get into town.
29797899,550797884,2019-10-19,137483737,Mary,Tony and Min's place is in a very convenient location for Heathrow airport and central London. It is beautifully furnished and well equipped. We were extremely comfortable in their lovely studio.

29797899,552322002,2019-10-21,144943661,Fernando,"Place is nice and clean, it has two queen beds with with nice and comfortable mattresses, washer and dryer. My fly was from terminal 5 and it took us 25 minutes (UBER) to get to the airport, we paid 16 pounds at 06:00 am it cost a little bit more during rush hours. There is a bus stop 4 minutes walking to the apartment, pay good attention to the instructions given to you, because it took me 30 minutes to find the place but in some way it was my fault, at the bus stop (Bus 423) walk about 200 mts in the same direction that the bus is going to ( i was coming from terminal 5 Heathrow, it took about 45 minutes), the rest its piece of cake, i didn't see any restaurants close by, i took UBER 6 pounds to get to a restaurant about a mile from the apartment. The apartment is a good choice if you want to stay close to the airport in your returning fly. There was coffee and some pastries, thanks Martin<br/>Nice apartment."
29797899,553949468,2019-10-25,233567291,Charlotte,"A really lovely space to stay, very stylish and modern whilst still being comfy! The owners were quick to respond to all messages and very helpful with their response. There were some really lovely little touches such as milk already being in the fridge and small snacks already in the house. It was also extremely clean and tidy. Myself and my two friends really enjoyed our stay!"
29797899,555010960,2019-10-27,296889666,Ian,Great place to stay! Clean and tidy and in a good location. Our son loved the Wii. Would stay again.

29797899,567069343,2019-11-21,687092,Deborah,"Great studio near London Heathrow. We got to stretch out in a comfortable bed, take hot showers and tour London all on a 12-hour layover!"

29797899,571616416,2019-12-01,296929694,April,"This place was a nice surprise! Much bigger than I expected, the beds were super comfy. It was nice having a washer and dryer to do a load of wash. The shower was nice, and they had a hair dryer I was able to use too. Really great place, wish I had been staying longer!"
29797899,572598716,2019-12-03,31279994,Chi,"I am such a critic and I tend to analyze everything with a fine tooth comb and I have to tell you that there is nothing I found that was wrong with Tony & Min's place. The check in process was so easy and our uber driver found the house pretty easily. There was ample street parking even though we did not have a car. <br/><br/>Upon entering the airbnb, we were taken aback by how huge of a space it was with the double beds. That was such a highlight for me since every other accommodation in Europe is so teeny. The bathroom and kitchen were also spacious alongside a washer and dryer that was available for use. There were also breakfast items for us to munch on. The bedroom/living room had heated floors and we had to enlist Tony, who came within minutes, to show us how to set the heat to a certain temperature. We ended up having a great conversation with him about issues we face in the U.S as Black Americans and how traveling can be very difficult when you are a minority. This was particularly touching for me as he was very receptive to our story and spoke about some of the issues that are present even in London. <br/><br/>The accommodation is also 15 minutes by uber to Heathrow which we took there and back. There is also a free bus less than a minute away which you can take to Hatton Cross station and the Piccadilly line will bring you anywhere you need to go. <br/><br/>I plan on staying at this airbnb again in the near future :)"
29797899,572894874,2019-12-04,15776838,Toni,Very clean space.  Kids needed milk in the AM and they were kind enough to bring it.  Nice touch!
29797899,574509250,2019-12-08,52151728,Charmain,"Tony/Min's place is easily accessible from Heathrow Terminal 5 and was the perfect choice for us as we had a long layover. It was clean, warm and comfortable. Tony and Min were also very accomodating with our request to check in at an earlier time. Highly recommended if you need a place that is near the airport."
29797899,575186850,2019-12-09,71701900,Erlane,"The place is super clean, spacious, cozy! For sure we’ll be back there again, thank you guys!<br/>Erlane and Edelmar"

29797899,576419660,2019-12-13,151326488,Ralph,Property is substantially larger than I anticipated for a “short stay” property near airport. Hospitality was 5 star; and host was incredibly helpful!

The home is beautiful and Min definitely makes it feel like home providing little goodies to snack on! They also provide the bus and train schedule which is very helpful. There is a free bus right out in front of their home that takes you to the train station and from there you can quickly get anywhere in the city that you want to go. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, we had a fantastic stay!"

The airport was only a short (free) bus ride away and had easy access to the tube. Tony/Min had exceptional hospitality! I will definitely be back if I have the  chance!"

29797899,605401116,2020-02-14,77046770,Lee,Tony and Mins place is an absolute find.  Deceptively spacious but lovely  warm and cosy with underfloor heating and very private.  All you could ask for from an Airbnb.  Brilliant.  Although I have not met Tony or Min there communication has been outstanding.  Top marks

29797899,613938855,2020-03-03,295144359,Kelli,"Wonderful stay! We were pleasantly surprised it was more like a side apartment than a shared space, great value for coming and going from the airport. It had all the amenities you need, including some breakfast items. They made a soft bed for the baby when we arrived and lots of extra bedding."
29797899,614764536,2020-03-06,170557582,James,"Lovely place. Clean, tidy, and inviting. Couldn’t have asked for more"

A huge place, really easy to park, access and get in the property.  Didn't have any f2f contact with the hosts, but they were great answering any queries and allowed for an early check in.<br/><br/>Small sitting area, TV, WiFi, huge kitchen area, great bathroom, could easily stay here comfortably for several days if you want to spend time in the greater London area.<br/><br/>Will defiantly book here again."

Our host's instructions were crystal-clear, and we had no problem finding parking or the location. Definitely would stay here again. Tony/Min put so much attention into the details that matter the most to what travelers might need, including having power adapters on hand. First class!"
29797899,620425030,2020-03-22,172832913,Christa,Very clean and modern space.  Walking on heated floors was a delight.  Tony asked us what breakfast groceries he could leave for us - very thoughtful.<br/>Convenient location - near Heathrow.  Bring earplugs - near Heathrow 
29797899,635373580,2020-07-06,24657571,Katherine,This place is so much bigger than I had realised! I enjoyed running down by the river while there too- a sweet little spot for anyone looking to stretch their legs.

The building is a bit rundown and old and quite quiet at night. The host has assured the neighbourhood is safe. But luckily amenities is quite near, min away from the apartment, So easy to get any groceries."
29853177,355274966,2018-12-03,55153360,Diana,The flat is very stylish and has a lot of character. We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend to anyone.
29853177,364280160,2018-12-30,17056545,Jennifer,"Great place to stay. Close to underground and minutes from downtown London. The only confusing thing was finding the lockbox (map showed a different location, should have wrote where it’s located). Also the password that was sent to us was the wrong one and we went 2 days without wifi. The correct password ended up being on a card in the house. Other then that everything was clean and organized. Would recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit London."
29853177,366157268,2019-01-02,127567789,Sofia,"Amazing house, close to underground stations, clean and very stylish. Stayed there for new years eve with my friends. Such a cosy and warm house, easy to cook breakfast and use all the amenities. Definitely recommend to future visitors !!!"

29853177,411433153,2019-02-12,240155305,Muhammad Al-Amin,If youre looking for a stylish apartment at a reasonable price that has direct access to London Underground this is the place for you. Who wouldn’t want everything close by. And this apartment offers just that. Also very good for muslim travellers as the restaurants around the area are mostly halal and reasonably priced. Amazing place!
29853177,418484788,2019-03-02,243687934,Wai Ching,"Great place in a great location. Loved that it was near to the tube station, supermarkets, a variety of shops, and places to eat."

29853177,451899925,2019-05-12,202664333,Hillary,The place was beautiful and very convenient to the Bush Theatre where guests were working. The only difficulty we had was slow communication with the host and some confusion around keys. Four guests had only one set of keys for the first three or four days of the stay. Eventually a second set was found but it was tricky enough to get to that point. Otherwise the place itself was lovely and very well situated.

29853177,475562557,2019-06-24,157019093,Jonathan,What you see is what you get. Great location near subway and grocery. I had a difficult time in locating the keybox and because it was only pinned in the map no pictures provided. But overall no problem with stay recommended
29853177,476964870,2019-06-27,146866078,Andrew,Location is great. Access directions and Communication fine.
29853177,499275714,2019-07-31,102927031,Ahmed,Looks clean at first but the couch and carpets were dirty. Half the cupboards were filled with dirty laundry. The washing machine needs fixing. The bathtub drainage needs fixing. Not a single fan available during the heat wave. The size of the apartment and locality was pretty good however i remain disappointed with my stay.
29853177,505378993,2019-08-09,253002765,Yang,"The flat is very closed to underground, location is pretty good. But it is also not so homestyle as my expectation. Hope it could be better managed."

Kitchen was well stocked and the bedrooms are spacious with full length mirrors. <br/><br/>Issy’s place is also located very near to bus stops and tube, which made it super easy for us to travel at any time of the day / night.<br/><br/>Issy and her boyfriend also helped my sister with her luggage, very nice people :)"

In my opinion the location is flawless. beds are super comfortable and communication is excellent, I'd say this flat it's trully well-managed. It has a grocery store 1 min walk, restaurants, and a playground just across if you are traveling with kids. I mean it's great"
29853177,570390783,2019-11-29,14975723,Gillian,"Issy's flat is in the best location.  Three tube stations within easy walking distance, depending on which line you are planning on traveling on.  It is large, with plenty of space for4 people.  Decent internet.  Very well-appointed kitchen.  Amazing beds and bed linens.  Great neighborhood.  The exterior of flats is a little disappointing, but this is a classic case of ""don't judge the book by the cover.""  We very much enjoyed our time here, and would highly recommend it to anyone."
29853177,574438516,2019-12-08,46234007,Er,"Issy and her team did an amazing job with my stay, very fast with communication. <br/>I needed to check in early and they did everything to accommodate me with an early check in. <br/>The place is exactly as described (looks the same as pictures)<br/>First floor you can find the kitchen and living room. 2nd floor you can find the bathroom and 2 bedrooms. <br/>The flat is located 2 mins from the tube - loved it! Made it very easy to commute.<br/>Highly recommended!"

A few small niggles which if you’re staying for a couple of days - you probably won’t notice- and if you’re staying longer you’ll soon get used to! <br/><br/>Great communication and flexibility from host & management company who were superb!"

Restaurants et commerce à proximités<br/>La chambre donnant sur la rue est un peu bruyante la nuit, mais c'est le prix à payer pour être proche de l’animation, par contre celle sur cour est parfaite, aucun bruit.<br/>Si nous retournons à Londres nous retournerons à cette adresse."

30335074,431985686,2019-04-02,91725454,Lisa,I was so excited for our stay in London.  Unfortunately our stay in this airbnb fell extremely short. Our first night we had no tv and the linens for the sofa bed were unclean and stained. The toilet seat was falling off and if you wanted to have a glass of wine - there was no corkscrew or wine glasses. Also forget about coffee as there is no coffee pot either. in addition you cannot cook anything even though there is a kitchen because there were no kitchen utensils. The main area is very cramped and small and would not accomodate 6 as the listing advertises. We were very tight with 4 and had to keep moving the furniture to get to the refrigerator.  Overall a very disappointing rental.
30335074,434732720,2019-04-08,4321931,Shilyh,This flat is wonderfully located but minimally equipped and extremely functional rather than cozy or cared for. We loved being in town​ but would have appreciated more comforts and a more responsive host.

30335074,512413568,2019-08-18,29599524,Conrad,Had a great time. I love the hustle and bustle of Camden so this was perfect for us. It is on a main road so the front bedroom can be loud at night (so bring earplugs) but the second bedroom at the back was perfectly quiet. I would definitely stay here again.

We were very close to the Camden Town Station, Whole Foods was right next door and there were lots of nice restaurants. The stairs can be a bit of a challenge if you have lot of luggage but we loved it."
30335074,542427562,2019-10-06,104019428,Guillaume,"The appartment is situated in a really interesting neighborood, and it is very functional. Close from the Camden market, close from the underground and also from the pubs and restaurants!<br/>Arrival was very well organized by Iwona, and the lockbox allowes a late arrival.<br/>A few details could improve the global comfort, which is already correct:<br/>It seems like a clogged pipe made the bathroom smell bad from time to time.<br/>The interior-spring mattress is not too firm, although we had a good sleep during our stay.<br/>The internet tv doesn't work good on all chanels, the image freezes and the sound squeezes.<br/>Globally it was a positive choice that we don't regret."
30335074,544110655,2019-10-09,117693828,Jason,"While there were some hiccups with communication, false promises of being able to leave our bags early and the cleaning crew not showing up for our checkin for the duration of our stay. Iwona did tru to fix the issues it just fell short of a clean apartment. Could of just been a bad day who knows. The apartment is very nice and modern and in a great location close to transportation, food and bars. While my review is not the greatest I would give iwona another chance staying there in the future."
30335074,547452406,2019-10-15,75368840,Graham,"Iwona is a lovely host. She communicates very well. We suggested some things during our stay and Iwona arranged these in no time! <br/><br/>Our family of four liked the location and convenience. There’s lots of shops, groceries and eateries. It can be a bit noisey at night. But overall we enjoyed our stay."
30335074,549038096,2019-10-18,64507466,Claire,Return trip x <br/>A great place and very good host communication <br/>Would definitely return
30335074,553881533,2019-10-25,113977197,Mark,"This is a great place located a short walk to the local tube station, buses, the Camden Market and lots of great pubs and bars"
30335074,557196189,2019-10-31,273336394,Sebastian,"Schicke Wohnung, super Lage!"

30335074,565938697,2019-11-18,28145156,Pauline,"Really nice apartment with 2 bedrooms. Really good location, 5min walk from the tube, 5min from Camden Market. A bit noisy, but this is a price to pay to be in the city center. I would recommend and come back any time! Check-in really easy, communication same. Thank you! :)"
30335074,567779084,2019-11-23,135902515,Lindy,"As others have reviewed the location is outstanding. So many places to eat, drink and buy food literally on your door step. <br/>Tube station short walk away and only a few stops from Kingscross/Euston Stations.<br/>We used earplugs and this allowed us to sleep well.<br/>There was building work going on in the shop below, looks like a complete refit starting just after 8am Mon to Sat. We were up and out early so didn’t bother us and it was finished when we arrived back after 6pm.<br/>If you’re looking for a base to explore that is clean and functional, yeah great. If you’re looking for 5* luxury, comfort and homely maybe not."
30335074,569047913,2019-11-25,50625474,French,"Il Bagno era indecente, sporchissimo e pieno di polvere oltretutto le piastrelle della vasca erano situate sotto il lavabo, la ventola dell’areazione era sudicia, e oltretutto l’host dopo la mia richiesta di rimborso ha insinuato che la ventola era esterna, mi pare di capire che non conosce il suo appartamento.  L’appartamento non era nello stato in cui le foto mostravano, inoltre a causa della polvere uno dei due bambini che erano nel gruppo ha avuto difficoltà respiratorie (allergica). La dispensa era piena di cibarie anche con muffa, specifico che la marmellata ne aveva uno<br/>Strato spesso un dito, mentre l’host aveva detto in un messaggio che non c’erano neanche il sale e l’olio per un discorso di igiene, il termoconvettore del salotto era staccato da terra, e la tenda della camera lievemente più grande era rotta Avevo indicato anche nella Prenotazione che c’era un bambino piccolo di un anno e una bambina di 6 anni! Ambiente non conforme. Sono veramente delusa. Il mio problema più grande è stato non conoscere la policy di Airbnb per fare immediatamente una segnalazione. Premetto che se alla richiesta del rimborso effettuata tramite app l’host avrebbe semplicemente risposto con un “mi dispiace” , non avrei scritto neanche questa recensione, ma dal momento in cui ho trovato una persona completamente indisposta è giusto che le persone che valuteranno di soggiornare in questo appartamento abbiamo la<br/>Possibilità di prenotare altrove."
30335074,572217874,2019-12-02,26986857,Elena,"A great apartment, very close to Camden Town tube station. Iwona was super friendly and quick to respond to all my questions, she also offered to help when we needed help with our luggage. <br/>Having said that, unfortunately the building right next to the apartment is currently under construction and is incredibly noisy. This of course is not the host's fault and did not make our stay any less great, however it would be good to be prepared and know this beforehand. <br/><br/>Overall, great value for money, centrally located apartment, thanks for everything!"
30335074,573183647,2019-12-05,78848695,James,A clean modern finished flat ideal for exploring Camden.
30335074,574553483,2019-12-08,274536398,Hazel,"Shop refit next door, noise all day from early morning.  <br/>No handrail on first flight stairs from street<br/>Situated just off Camden High St which was very convenient, lots of bars & restaurants in easy reach & very close on foot to Camden Market<br/>Bedding supplied plentiful & spotless as were the towels<br/>Great communication from Iwona & Oz"
30335074,577281497,2019-12-15,51243180,Joe,Excellent location. Very clean. 2 big bedrooms but mattresses not comfortable. It says there is a bed in the living room but its a couch that is not comfortable. It is currently over a building site and the construction workers started working at 8am Saturday morning
30335074,580090387,2019-12-22,251229465,昕瑶,"its location is suitable and the space is enough.  However, the hot water is not enough for the bath and the rooms are little dirty.  In the front of the door, there were some rubbish bags therefore it was hard to make our luggages into the door."
30335074,588239466,2020-01-04,142320285,David,"Great apartment. Spacious main bedroom, amazing location, comfortable amenities. Underground is such a short walk away, the restaurants right around it are brilliant - literally was perfect for us. Would highly recommend!!"
30335074,594889852,2020-01-19,297147642,Daniel,"This place has all the potential to be a 5-star place, but it is not there yet. <br/><br/>The location is magnificent— Camden is magical: full of hustle and bustle and fantastic energy. With the tube just a quick walk away. The apartment itself is spacious, comfortable, and has a lovely view of the neighborhood. <br/><br/>However:<br/>The stairs in the entry way have no handrail. The stairs in the flat are quite narrow. (I was traveling with my father and it was imposing). <br/><br/>The shower only comes with enough hot water for one shower. The second person (or if you have more than that) will be bathing in cold water. Bummer. <br/><br/>If you are going to book this talk to the host and ensure construction on the next-door restaurant is complete. I do not recommend staying here while that is going on. They start early in the day and also work on weekends. The workers would stand and smoke in the entryway, and they would leave bags of concrete, wood scraps, and miscellaneous items blocking the walkway to enter the flat. <br/><br/>To reiterate, it has the potential to be a great place, and I would even consider staying here again— once the kinks have been ironed out."
30335074,609698209,2020-02-23,2846444,Leigh,Great location
30335074,612344919,2020-02-29,42198026,Geoffrey,"L'appartement est très bien situé au coeur de Camden à deux pas du métro. Les consignes pour trouver la maison sont très claires et le contact avec Iwona très facile.<br/>L'appartement est fonctionnel avec une partie vie (cuisine / salon / salle de bains) au premier étage et deux chambres au deuxième étage.<br/>Cependant, il faut quand même noter que l'isolation phonique est très limite et que l'appartement est donc vraiment très bruyant, difficile de dormir. Surtout qu'à cela s'ajoutent des rideaux quasi inexistants"
30335074,616285529,2020-03-09,48506144,Alex,Perfect heart of Camden location! Great space. :)

30335074,643278806,2020-07-27,160325652,Ann,Het appartement van Iwona is prima gelegen om Londen te verkennen. Het ligt vlakbij een metrostation in de bruisende wijk Camden. Voor ons was het wel te klein om er met vijf te kunnen verblijven. Zo zijn er maar vier stoelen en ook onvoldoende bestek. We hadden ook een probleem met de badkamer maar dat is direct opgelost.
30335074,652771144,2020-08-17,179534975,Melissa,"Great host, quick communication. Really nice place "

30415048,428503484,2019-03-25,75923474,Youssef,"The house was wonderful, we have private bathroom and the principal room is such big, the garden is amazing and relaxing ( with fontaine and floures...)<br/>Mira and her husband were very kind and very welcoming, my opinion : i'm traveler and this experience is one of my best airbnb"
30415048,431577052,2019-04-01,138587138,Mark,"If there was a poll to rate the best AirBnB in South London, this AirBnB would be one of the favourites. It is truly 5 stars in the stated categories.  Belmira is a fantastic host; her property offers sublime comfort and quality. The stay included an excellent breakfast. Overall, it beat my expectations. The host is setting the standards for all competitors to follow.<br/>Thank you very much Bella, I really enjoyed my stay and was really happy to have met you and zephyr. I will definitely stay again, if you have the availability.<br/>Kind regards, Mark"

30415048,446805478,2019-05-02,18266103,Wayne,"I have been staying here Monday to Thursday for 3 months, its an ideal place for working away fro home, has everything you need and is in a safe area with proper off road parking."
30415048,449296837,2019-05-06,135010157,George,"Serene, Tranquil, peaceful, calm, 5 star +++, warm friendly, personable; I could go on, but my limited vocabulary will never do justice to the couple of nights (I wish it had been longer), I spent staying with Belmira, and Zafar, in their delightful home. <br/>I  was instantly put at ease, and became as relaxed as I am at home, staying in this stunning 5 star family home. I agree with all of the reviews, and especially with Marks comments. <br/>I'm a little reticent to publish this review, because when you find the jewel in the crown, you want to keep it all to yourself, but honesty must prevail. I look forwards to stayin with Belmira, and Zafar in the future, but realise that I might have to plan well in advance, as their popularity (as apparent by the other reviews), will go from strength to strength. <br/>I haven't even mentioned; the reasonable rates, the off street parking, the comfy king size bed, with ensuite, the breakfast choices, the lovely garden, the home made cake, the snacks for my journey home, but I think you've got the picture now; ""Above and beyond"" prepare to be wowed people!"
30415048,450363009,2019-05-09,18266103,Wayne,"Spotlessly clean, is exactly as described and is in a safe area. Belmira is a great host."

They are very special people and this is reflected in the standards they set themselves to ensure their guests have everything they could possibly want or need. They told me I was their first lady guest and spoilt me with a glass of bubbly when I arrived to celebrate that.<br/>Bless you both, and thank you, you’re the best hosts."
30415048,461786154,2019-06-01,4614934,Andrew,Lovely room in a lovely house in a very quiet road. Belmira was the perfect host. Would happily stay again.

Not for a moment I felt I was living in someone else's home.<br/>Both Belmira and Zafar welcomed me, and treated to a nice cup of tea and Cake.

30415048,513217679,2019-08-19,275146357,Deborah,The room with a private bathroom is top of the line. Everything is thought of down to fresh flowers in the bathroom and a fruit bowl to snack on . There is everything you need or even forgot to pack. I would stay again in a snap.

30415048,524715955,2019-09-06,135010157,George,"I booked at very late notice, so I was very lucky to visit (for a second time), this beautiful, & most definitely Serene home. <br/>It was such a shame I could only stay for one night. I feel totally relaxed as soon as I am greeted by Belmira.<br/>Belmira & Zafar are a wonderful hospitable hosts. Not only are you in a beautiful, Serene, & comfortable home, but another great treat awaits you in the morning; as Belmira prepares a bountiful delicious breakfast, of your choosing, to start your day. If you wish to converse Belmira is on hand, or if you want to get on with your day, that is fine as well.<br/>If I could give more than 5 gold stars I would. Airbnb will have to come up with a higher standard, 5 Platinum stars, or maybe 5 diamonds for Belmira."

Lovely and cozy room with en-suite, nice fruits and breakfast, thoughtful caring of picking us from the train station and wait until night.

Not to forget the lovely apples i pick from her garden. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend Bellas home, and will book again when i am back to london Would definitely use Airbnb again"

Relaxing,  regenerating, catching up with my family (who all live locally). From watching the footy on their large TV, to relaxing in the garden, it was more like taking a family  holiday than just  a BnB stay.<br/>I don't  knowabout 5 stars; I concur with all the other reviewers, & would give 10 stars if I could!

A short 10 min, brisk walk to the Worcester Park Station and a ten minute train ride to Wimbledon Station. Belmira offered me lifts to/from the station though. Exceptionally good value with an honest price, not inflated for the Championships , and not much more than the price of parking your car there for the day! <br/><br/>5* accommodation to a hotel standard, together with all the advantages of being in a house. I agree with all the other very positive reviews.<br/><br/>Book now for next year!"

There are 2 stations nearby and I arrived at Malden Manor and Bella picked us up. There was confusion at first which station but eventually all worked out! Lovely home and indeed the best garden I’ve ever seen! Would for sure recommend and with breakfast included it’s a great value."

The room is spacious, clean and  warm, the bathroom very convenient with everything provided just in case you forgot to bring something. The bed is comfortable and I had good sleep throughout all nights. <br/><br/>Bella is passionate about hosting that she’s kind to offer pick up from station, picked some apples from trees in garden and let me try and serve breakfast etc. She had prepared different kinds of tea and many jams and cereal choices at breakfast too. <br/><br/>And don’t miss the garden if you have time, very big and beautiful garden. My schedule was busy so pity I didn’t enjoy a coffee overlooking her garden. <br/><br/>Overall it’s really enjoyable stay at Bella’s home and I appreciated for every effort she’s trying made guest had wonderful stay."

Highly recommended!"

30499561,415350053,2019-02-22,67087904,Tenaya,"My partner and I stayed at Rebecca’s place for two nights while looking for flats to rent in London. <br/><br/>Rebecca’s place is great value for money. It’s clean and cozy and very private. It’s a 12 minute walk from the station and there are buses that go right to the street the house is near, ~5 min walk. Her home is beautifully decorated and nice and warm- very welcoming. Rebecca is a lovely host and although our check in was a bit later than we had planned, she was very quick to respond and arrange with us. She was also very knowledge about London and different areas to visit or look  for flats in. <br/><br/>The only thing I would say though is that the bed is quite squeaky generally, so if there’s two of you and one of you is a restless and light sleeper- bring earplugs. I did and wasn’t too bothered by the noise, but my partner (who tosses and turns quite a lot in his sleep) kept waking himself up. Overall I would definitely recommend staying here if you want a safe and cozy room to sleep in."
30521626,361078249,2018-12-22,99310253,Abdullah,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

30810434,511529610,2019-08-17,27768006,Yisha,The space is very stylish! Very clean. Great location.
30810434,574329004,2019-12-08,103430915,Aliya,"This was a nice clean place with good facilities. However, there was a strange sign on one of the windows saying that there was video surveillance. Obviously this was very concerning to us, we contacted the hosts admin but didn't get a response so there was a lot of back and forth without an answer. It wasn't until we said that if we didn't receive a response soon we would escalate the matter, that the hosts admin got back to us immediately and gave us an answer which didn't put our minds at ease. They said the sticker was for the main entrance but we felt that if that was the case then why was this sticker on the window of this apartment(on the top floor). We have raised this matter with Airbnb. Additionally, it appeared that the apartment was currently being lived in as all the hosts belongings were present, including cloths in the wardrobes and toothbrushes in the bathroom and family pictures. This was bizarre to us and meant that there wasn't much storage space for our belongs/cloths etc."
31087595,405117140,2019-01-26,8212294,Jens,"A very nice place, very calm, and only a few meters from the Underground station (no noise from trains!) which is indeed very convenient. District line brings you directly to Central London. I felt very welcome, and the communication was easy (English and French spoken). The room is not big, but with kitchen and bathroom next door, so it's almost as having your own private little corner. Very clean and with everything I could think of including breakfast. I highly recommend this place!"

Quiet location, very comfortable bed and clean flat. Bedroom quite basic. Shared bathroom small with a not very good electric shower [I’ve yet to come across a good electric shower anyway!]"

31141775,404279286,2019-01-23,119469163,Aimee,"Billie and Max’s place is great! Lovely leafy location and perfect for getting about London as only a 5/10 minute walk to the tube station. <br/><br/>The apartment was lovely, clean and had everything you would need for a short stay in London. <br/><br/>We were a little cold at times as the radiators didn’t get very hot but this didn’t bother us too much as we were only there one night. However, great communication with the hosts as we told them when we left and they have already had a plumber in to check everything is working as it should! <br/><br/>Great place, great hosts, would definitely stay again!"
31141775,404493338,2019-01-24,36732467,Jayne,"What a lovely find! The location was perfect- just a short stroll to Kensington park (right next to Hyde park) and so close to some great London attractions including Harrods and the Natural History Museum and also importantly transport links. <br/><br/>There were some lovely touches in the apartment including a magazine, access to Netflix (if you already have an account) and a file with some local tips of places to go and eat. <br/><br/>The hosts were always easy to get in touch with and the electronic key system was brilliant, so there was no need to have a specific check in time as the keys were readily available via an app after check in time. <br/><br/>The apartment itself was beautiful with some basic kitchen items and in a lovely building, which is currently having some final building touches done so it all feels very new and clean. I think it’s a lovely apartment, great location and a brilliant price and wouldn’t hesitate to book again!"
31141775,405493542,2019-01-27,234484491,Olivia,"The room was lovely and clean and looked as it does in photos.  The location was also perfect, within a 2 min walk to a corner shop and close walk to Kensington Highstreet.  The building did have building work going on during the day but we were aware of this and didn't cause us any problems.  There were some great suggestions for places to eat and visit if you are a new tourist to the area.  Overall we really enjoyed our stay and will definitely look at booking Billie and Max's rooms again!"
31141775,406056360,2019-01-28,222064392,Kris,"Beautiful studios with classy high-spec decor. Excellent location close to restaurants, tube stations and Hyde Park. The only downside I would say was that the second room we slept in was very very cold, but I Believe this will be taken care of. Everything is was wonderful, we would rent again from Max and Billie."

31141775,411725908,2019-02-13,104962438,Erin,Wonderful location!  Very close to the Tube and a good value. Billie and Max even let us keep our bags in their office for the day until check-in time so that we could explore the city more easily. Would definitely come back.

31141775,429209565,2019-03-27,10265066,Cecilia,"Wow. This studio in a  modernized Georgian building was absolutely stunning and surrounded by beauty on all sides with spring in almost full bloom now in London. It’s easily identifiable with the pink door and plushly decorated. I wish I could have stayed more than one night! I haven’t slept so well during my whole stay in Europe. The apartment is bright modern and perfectly located near Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park and Notting Hill. <br/><br/>The balcony overlooks a quiet neighborhood street making it easy to spot your Uber driver or taxi in style when you open the blinds and sit in the well appointed marble table. Or go out into the balcony. The space is small but feels roomy with high ceilings and mirrors. The bathroom was pristinely clean with plush towels, all the hot water for the bath I needed to feel clean after a long flight. <br/><br/>I hope to return very soon! Thanks for having me! Don’t hesitate to stay beee if you’d like to be in a posh neighborhood setting in a very safe and beautiful area."

The room itself was adorable, with great closet space and large windows. We loved the balcony and enjoyed wine and cheese on it more than once. The neighborhood itself it so cute and has fun bars, restaurants, coffee shops and a Whole Foods within walking distance. We are so happy with our stay here & are already planning to go back!"

Very clean, lots of extra towels, and a drinking water machine on the same floor. Klevio app for keys was very easy to use, would be better if more than one person could download the keys in case one of us came back at different times. There’s also a cute little patio outside. My friend and I really enjoyed staying here, definitely recommend!!"
31141775,451879555,2019-05-12,170987244,Nick,"My Partner and I had a great stay, the flat is better in person than the pictures. I like to think we are tech savvy but when checking in using Klevio oddly I was looking for somewhere to swipe the phone so did stand at the front of the property for a good 10 minutes debating if it was the right one. The flat was immaculate and the small balcony space a nice little bonus. Would love to stay again if we were visiting London."

We enjoyed the large windows and balcony.  We were located close to bus lines and the tube.  The area has a lot of restaurants and boutiques to enjoy. And we did.  We ate right around the corner at “Churchill Arms”  a quaint pub that served some of the best Thai food we’ve  ever had.  We couldn’t have been happier with our stay in London and hope to come back soon.  Thank you for making our visit superb."

31141775,477542954,2019-06-28,189085561,Carl,"Firstly, the location is stunning. You are basically a few minutes away from Kensington High Street and the balcony is just fabulous. It is a lovely room and incredibly plush. Communication from the host was outstanding. They were brilliant at responding when we had questions and even made up the sofa bed for us on special request. I thibk you would be hard pressed to find lovlier hosts or location. Unfortunately there was a stain on the bed and we just couldn't work out how to use the hob so had to give up. There also isnt a plug on the kitchen unit so we had to move the kettle next to the bed but all in all we didn't mind. The Klevia key would be easy if it told people to swipe right on the key. I spent 5 mins tapping it but realised you just need to swipe it then tap. I would stay in the room again tomorrow - it is truly special."
31141775,479640035,2019-07-01,58567679,Julie,"Wonderful, relaxing stay in Kensington. Perfect location in a quaint neighborhood. The hosts were very quick to respond to all questions. Cannot wait for our next stay!"

31141775,492245766,2019-07-21,122782066,Molly,"Had a great stay at Billie and Max’s place. Amazing location. Unfortunately, we didn’t get the opportunity to meet Billie or Max. All of the keys in this Airbnb are electronic - AKA don’t let your phone run out of battery when you’re out during that day!!! Also, the power went out and so we weren’t able to enter the building until someone from the inside was able to let us in."

Billie/Max's team was very kind and polite when we dropped off bags); Technology (keyless entry with an app on your phone).<br/>Cons - Size (It's a studio so we expected it to be small. It was fine for the 3 of us for 2 nights but it's not ideal if you need a lot of space); Kitchen (the studio had a hot plate, small dorm-size fridge, electric kettle, and the basics but it's not somewhere you can cook an elaborate meal. We weren't planning on eating in so we just used the kettle for tea and the fridge for water/fruit).<br/>Thanks Billie and Max!"

I can’t say enough things about this place. <br/><br/>Location is great- a quick walk from two underground stations and Kensington Palace and Gardens. Also super quiet and stylish. <br/><br/>Apartment was super clean and updated for being in an older style home. <br/><br/>The hosts were fabulous! Quick to respond and great recommendations for anything you needed. They are very friendly and we’re very accommodating with holding our luggage until check-in.<br/><br/>If this one is on your list, don’t pass it up!"

31141775,527255129,2019-09-10,97860953,Steph,A great few days in London. The location was perfect considering we’d never been to London before! It was in the main tourist spot which was great but located so close to everything. We felt like locals walking the streets. The studio was clean and had everything and more that we needed! Once we got the wifi working downstairs it was easy to get in and out of the building.

It is the perfect space to come back and relax in after a long day out.
31141775,536643760,2019-09-27,133239042,Guadalupe,"London is a large city. If your looking for something close to Hyde Park this place was within 20-30 minutes walking distance, and less than 10 minutes from the tube station. Quiet  and safe area in the city. Not able to utilize kitchen area. For us it was basically a place to sleep and shower."

The ceilings were high so it felt very spacious! The studio is near two underground stations so getting around London is super easy. We didn’t Uber at all!

The area alone was enough for me but on top of that, the place was very clean and had lots of towels which we very much appreciated. The lock system was easy and convenient. Easy access to two different tube stations. Can’t say enough good things about this place and when we come back to London, we’re coming here!"

The tube station was also very close.<br/>Billie and Max were great hosts: very responsive as well as accommodating. There were 3 of us that stayed, which definitely worked, though 2 probably would have been a bit more comfortable. The flat was very clean, there were plenty of towels, and some dishes, cups and pans.<br/>I would recommend this property to anyone traveling to London!"

There were thoughtful touches of toiletries, tea kettle, toaster, hot plate, spices, dishes, my unit had a bath tub- everything was clean. My only wish was an elevator- my unit was on the 2nd floor. When other guest on the floor closed their doors it was a little loud but bearable. I will definitely come back. There is a complementary laundry on the ground floor."

31876108,495723032,2019-07-26,105184298,Daniel,"Andreas’s flat is in a brilliant location for all of central London.  The room is great with ample room for a couple of nights stay.  The kitchen is well appointed but there are also a bewildering array of  eateries nearby, which Andreas is quick to signpost too.<br/><br/>It’s in a quiet area so very little street noise and everything you need for a good nights sleep."
31876108,499432469,2019-07-31,12473188,Torsten,"I had the best time during my short stay at Andreas's place in Angel. The flat is just great, stylish and has all the amenities you will ever need. It is very well located, with both Highbury & Islington as well as Angel Station in walking distance. And then there is your host Andreas who makes you feel as if you are visiting a close friend that you have never met before - welcoming, thoughtful, easy to communicate with, just a great person. There are also many cafes and restaurants nearby and Andreas recommended a few that were definitely worth the visit. The fact we both share the same passion (photography) made my stay even better than I expected. Thanks for everything Andreas!"

They made us feel really comfortable throughout our stay and were always ready to help us personally either by visiting the flat or over the phone, text & Airbnb.<br/><br/>Overall our stay was brilliant and the flat was super clean and well maintained with some really nice decor throughout. The location itself was perfect, far from all the noise and hustle but still close to the city centre if you’re driving or only about a 6-8 minute walk to the Elephant & Castle tube station and also you can see the shard building right from the car park which was more beautiful when lit during the night.<br/>Would comeback again and definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a relaxing and a peaceful stay in London.<br/><br/>Thanks a lot again."

I work in London and had to find a place for a month and found this flat at a great price. Preeti is new to Airbnb but her place is stylish and comfortable. Preeti is very friendly and caring; she chats with me everyday and kept very quiet if she needs to go out early. Her place is very convenient for me to travel to work during weekdays and I have really enjoyed exploring Greenwich area during the weekends. The neighbourhood is very quiet and safe, with cherry blossoms in the spring! The common area is kept sparkly clean and everything is very tidy.

32492648,546054736,2019-10-13,142473190,Cleo,"The place is great, clean, nice design and finish, and the location is great. Three bedrooms and three baths is not easy to find in London, which works perfectly for us (we were traveling with parents from both sides. I would like to recommend others and my family like space. <br/><br/>The reason I only give a total of three stars is that we did not get hot water throughout our stay, which brought huge inconvenience to our trip. We found it out the first night and contacted the customer support team. One person stopped by that night, but could not fix the issue, we end up using another apartment in the building to take a shower. The team sent people over the next day while we were out, and promised the issue was fixed. (I asked in the phone if everything was working, and did we need a plan B, but the person told us the team was confident we would have hot water that night). However, there was NO hot water again that night, and we could not use the other apt because people had checked in already. Hence, all of us could not take a hot water shower the night before we left UK. <br/><br/>I spent hours on the phone with customer support (has more than 10 calls throughout the two days), which was an extra burden during a trip. The team was very nice and tried their best to support, as well as offer compensation and refund. But not able to solve the issue nor provide a contingency plan in time did bring our family frustration and inconvenience."

32492648,582661371,2019-12-27,109341928,Nick,"Beautiful apartment! Our two biggest compliments here would be on cleanliness of the space as well as location. The apartment is smartly and stylishly furnished with a beautiful kitchen that includes all of the necessities. Everything looks new. Sparkling clean from top to bottom. The location is fantastic as the apartment building is on a quiet and residential street, but with coffee shop and convenience store a block away. All of the sights and bustle we were looking for were within a 10 minute walk. Could not have asked for more.<br/>Also, I read another review regarding the hot water in the showers. We had 4 people staying in the apartment, using the showers as well as the kitchen and laundry, and did not have any issues. Fantastic hot showers for those who read previous reviews."

The room was clean, organized, and small. Just what I needed for one night. Her hospitality was amazing as she gave me directions as to how to go to the airport and move around the city of London.<br/>It’s a shame I couldn’t stay any longer at London; however, I already know where to stay again next time I go to London for more days.

32887675,555899043,2019-10-28,137402529,Kaori,"The location is amazing, because we can reach the place by tube from the airport. You might feel a little bit long time, but it's better to change the tube for a couple of times with a big luggage. And, it's a quiet cozy area, not like a busy city side. But, you can find good cafes and some small supermarkets as well. <br/>The room is exactly same as Nicola posted on Airbnb. I felt just good enough. Clean, cozy, just excellent. And, Nicola replies quickly all the time. You don't feel any stress including check in and out. She is very flexible, friendly, and charming. Highly recommend it !"

Nice quiet environment to stay at in London.
32887675,565984973,2019-11-18,18614149,Mark,"Being next door to a bathroom can have its drawbacks but the superb quality mattress helped make up for this, and who doesn't like a room with a balcony? It's a luxurious bathroom by the way. Shower doesn't do ice cold if that matters to you.  Place is spotlessly clean and Nicola is a friendly and generous host.  Good value for its location."
32887675,566714064,2019-11-20,113970710,Hyunjoo,"The place is good. It takes 10 minutes to walk to Arsenal Station and 15 minutes to Finsbury Station. Good location, nice host and lovely house."

32887675,574360370,2019-12-08,22937379,Ta Wei,"Nicola's place was such a lovely refuge after some sightseeing at the hectic crowded places in London. Close to the Arsenal station on the Piccadilly line, it's an easy zip down to central London as well as Heathrow airport. I had the pleasure of meeting both Nicola and her husband Simon, and they were absolutely lovely and caring. Would most highly recommend their place to anyway needing a place to stay in London!"
32887675,575109895,2019-12-09,130536776,Dimitrios,"I only met Nicola's husband(I guess).<br/>When I arrived they had dinner, made noise and switching on and off light that is outside the door(which is hard if you are used to darkness to sleep) until around 12-1 am and in the morning they were awaken by 7 am and chatting. <br/>The wifi was pretty slow and couldnt connect inside the room, had to use my mobile data.<br/>The heating didnt work even though if you used the blankets it was not cold.<br/>In the morning I took a shower and in the middle of the shower the water got cold.<br/><br/>The area is not exactly in the center of London but in a more quiet area, the room was pretty small and clean. It had a kettle inside the room and a wardrobe which had clothes inside."

32887675,703254667,2020-10-24,7571125,Charley,"Nicola's place is perfect for a solo traveller looking for a comfortable place to stay and a very warm welcome from the host. Nicola responded to my message straight away and made arrangements for me to check-in, in case the family weren't home. As it happened there was somebody home to let me in and show me to my room, which is a beautifully decorated and very comfortable bedroom at the back of the house, right next to the shower room / toilet. I had a wonderful night's sleep in a comfortable bed, in a very quiet part of the house. In the morning Nicola had laid out a fantastic breakfast with a choice of different cereals, porridge and fruit, plus tea and coffee. I was able to help myself to that, although Nicola was on hand for a chat and some local transport advice. The whole place was spotlessly clean and stylishly decorated. The bathroom has a great rain-drop shower too. <br/><br/>All in all I can't fault Nicola's place at all. I was made to feel very welcome but left to come and go as I pleased. I can't recommend this place highly enough."

I was at Nicola's home for 3 days and I was warmly welcomed, there's even coffee and tea at your disposal in the bedroom. <br/>Nicola is definitely accomodating and I enjoyed my stay. Ideal for a single traveler or couple. There's a garden behind the house so I woke up with singing birds, which is for me an important detail to notice. The shared bathroom was not an issue for me and it was clean. To my French fellow citizens : vous pouvez lui faire confiance !"

33159522,440932964,2019-04-21,129094236,Jude,"The apartment is just over half a mile from 2 tube stations, at just over 20 minutes on the tube to Westminster it's perfectly located for visiting the sights.  The allocated parking space saved us money as driving worked out cheaper than three train tickets from Manchester!<br/><br/>The apartment itself was just like the pictures, bright and spacious with everything we needed for our 3 night stay.  It did get a little warm during the day (an unusually hot Easter!) but once we opened the balcony door and put the fans on it soon cooled down.  Arrival and departure were as easy as could be.<br/><br/>As a hostess I can't praise Anya highly enough, her proactive and friendly communication were greatly appreciated; she was prompt to  respond to any messages I sent her.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend both the apartment and Anya as a hostess."

I would have liked essentials like paper towels to be provided, however that would not deter me from staying again. Great spot!"
33159522,506109923,2019-08-10,6809392,Olu,"Anya is a responsive and diligent host.  The flat has all the basic requirements, was clean, easily assessible and check-in/check out processes were straight forward."

Location is great, close to bus stops that take you to tube stations. We'll definitely look forward to booking again next time!"
33159522,639454314,2020-07-18,72444741,Zoe,Anya fast response and positive attitude Allowed us to book last minute. The place is exactly as you see in pictures. There is a lot of  kitchen tools available and furniture is comfortable. The place was spotless and it was a really easy self check-in. The location is very easy to get to and a parking space is provided given an extra cost which is great.Would recommend for a small family or professional couple. The only downside is the actual flat itself was very very hot this meant that a fan in every room was on constantly. And the TV Didn’t work but we linked it to our laptop so we didn’t mind that much. Overall I would highly recommend this flat as anya is a very amazing host And always a pleasure to talk to.I’ll be happy to come back again.

33422240,480638990,2019-07-03,25776659,Don,"This is a lovely apartment with a balcony, fully equipped kitchen, spacious living area and bedroom, and easy entry. Lucy met us outside the building, and gave us a full orientation to the apartment and local area. She asked us what our plans were and offered us advice on how to get around and some key places to go. Less than 15 minutes walk to the nearest tube station (Mile End) and a slightly longer walk along the canal to the very large and popular Victoria Park. This stay was at the end of a month-long visit to Europe. We experienced several sub-standard Airbnbs - very happy our last four nights were in such a welcoming and relaxing space, well deserving of five stars."

The apartment is near to the tube, is decorated beautifully and has everything you need for a stay. <br/><br/>Lucy was kind enough to leave us tea, coffee and breakfast items as well as there being shampoo and shower gel in the bathroom which is good as less to pack! <br/><br/>The apartment is near some nice parks so in the morning we went to the Victoria Park food market to buy food for lunch and then took a stroll along the canal to Canary Wharf. It’s nice to see water and wildlife in central London! <br/><br/>We would happily stay here again when we are visiting London.<br/><br/>Thanks Lucy for your hospitality."
33422240,641012680,2020-07-22,287097511,Darragh,"Beautiful stay in an apartment block with balcony overlooking Mile End Park and Regents Canal.

33422240,654747903,2020-08-22,57296033,Ali,"Lucy’s place is conveniently located in the calmer area of Palmer’s Road so you can enjoy a restful night, on a higher floor with no direct sunlight which makes it cooler during the warm August  There’s also a nice balcony.<br/>Lucy has decorated her home with great taste and comfortably. The kitchen is well equipped.<br/>There’s a washing machine and iron as well, quite handy for longer stays!"
33422240,659316880,2020-09-01,29947268,Bridget,"Absolutely lovely spacious flat, everything you need to hand.  Really well situated for the tube and buses, and great for walking along the canal, enjoying Mile End and Victoria Parks. Lucy very helpful, we had a great stay."

Richard was extremely helpful with information before we arrived and check in and out was easy using the lock box.<br/><br/>The location was great, handy for the town centre and the station.<br/><br/>The house had everything we needed for our stay and was much better than staying in somewhere like the travelodge, and was better value too!<br/><br/>Would definitely stay here again."

The flat was clean and neighbors were friendly. Super easy check-in. The parking was a bit confusing as it initially looked like you were turning into a bike path, but once we figured that out...<br/>Owner was super quick to respond to any questions. Our family of 6 was comfortable and had a great visit."

Apart from that, Anna was very friendly and helpful, and even offered me some of her food for dinner when I arrived late one night, not having eaten yet. The room was spacious enough and had more than plenty of wardrobe space. Everything was very clean. The little desk allowed me to work on my laptop – wifi was perfect."
34239465,530000148,2019-09-15,5405089,Stefka,"Anna’s place is extremely well located just few minutes from Regents Park as well as Baker Street tube station. The room was sparkling clean, there is a small fridge and a hair drier in the room. The towels provided were of a great quality too. Anna had also kindly left some fruit, orange juice and milk as well as some muesli for me. There’s a lift in the building (a rarity for a Central London location), so that’s great for the heavy luggage."
34239465,535895478,2019-09-25,4993139,Mengda,"It’s a lovely apartment in a safe, beautiful, convenient neighborhood. Anna was nice, helpful, and responsive. She prepared great cereal, fruits, juice, tea, coffee, and milk in my room. The kitchen is open and full of tools.<br/><br/>The only flaw is that the door of the bedroom cannot be locked from inside, which did bring me some pressure at night.."

While the rooms are in an apartment Anna has provided some thoughtful touches to make them more independent, like a mini fridge, kettle, etc."
34239465,564216459,2019-11-15,220057196,Anuj,Anna is a very considerate and caring host. She is also very smart to have a conversation with. She keeps the place very clean and with all required gadgets. All in all a home away from home.

Deeply apologised and offered a bottle of wine as ""compensation"" - but to anyone - try hard to avoid this situation as hosts are older couple and  will surely not appreciate this. <br/>Was rightfully unwelcomed because my late arrival, but upgraded to a double although  booked a single. left early. Apart the incident - very good value."

34312448,487818187,2019-07-14,143977024,Miguel,"A minha escolha prendeu-se com os comentários muito positivos sobre a hospitalidade da anfitriã. Infelizmente, e no meu caso, não me senti nem bem recebido nem bem vindo. Talvez tenha sido azar, mas comigo foi o que aconteceu. Sugestão: apesar das horas indicadas para check-in, é necessário que informem os anfitriãos que devem estar preparados para receber as visitas até ao limite indicado. Talvez tenha sido por aí que não senti um bom acolhimento por parte da anfitriã, pois apresentei-me praticamente no limite do horário estabelecido (a anfitriã estava informada disso)."

34360266,457451764,2019-05-24,20867285,Gábor,"Julie's home was absolutely spot on for my needs! Description is accurate, you get what she offers in the listing. I think it is a good location if you don't mind a little Subway travel from central  London. Nice neighborhood, quite, lush greenery and blooming flowers in every garden, with very kind people around. Really well maintained area away from the crowd. I always prefer to leave the toxic and noisy city centrals for the favour of lover costs, calm people, and all the benefits of suburban areas. If you like to be in London but still a bit away from it for evenings, this is the right place. Julie is really friendly, loves traveling and  absolutely happy to help if you need to ask anything. So go ahead stay in her home and start with a little chat with her. It will nicely kickstarts you visit in London. And always, be nice and respect her home! Have a safe travel everyone!"

Janet is a lovely host, she actively looks after her guests making sure they have everything they need, she also gave us great advice about the area and local amenities.<br/><br/>The room is located close to the Leytonstone tube and a big supermarket, so if you're planning a long stay you won't have any issues moving around the city or getting some groceries home.<br/><br/>The room is cozy and comfortable and there's plenty of space to store your things.<br/>The bathroom is located under the stairscase but the shower is surprisingly big, also it was perfectly clean when we first arrived. Same for the kitchen that has everying you may need to prepare a meal.<br/><br/>The cats are all nice and they are kinda the stars of the house.

34809262,505444073,2019-08-09,4428059,Avery,"Wonderfully located flat - great proximity to trains, busses, and lots of sights. The Paddington basin / Little Venice is great for eating and bars and a stroll. <br/><br/>Flat is very private and quiet. Feels removed from the city when, in fact, you’re smack in the middle of it. <br/><br/>Not ideal for children as there are a lot of stairs and sharp, architectural corners.

34809262,515480761,2019-08-23,112860114,Sheng,这个房子不是联排别墅，是一个地下室，预定前你一定要注意，与描述有严重不符，周边环境也不好，没有安全感，室内卫生条件也存在很多问题，很陈旧！我们由于到的晚当天没办法勉强等到第二天，迅速离开！要求房东取消预定退款，至今没有收到回复，已经要求平台协助处理，坐等结果！
34809262,523780174,2019-09-04,109906403,Harley,"This is a lovely ""hideaway"" townhouse gem situated behind a gate and wedged behind a curbside house. The bedrooms are below grade and face away from the street so they are generally quiet. One can hear the soft rumble of the trains on the Circle/District lines running through a neighborhood trench about 100 feet away, but the noise and vibration would only affect the lightest of sleepers. The living room is situated above-grade and pleasant to hang out in, though we barely used it. Aside from finding the full-size refrigerator/freezer inoperative without warning from the host, and some difficulty regulating the temperature of the shower in the 2nd bathroom off the hall, this turned out to be overall a good choice of a home away from home for our family of 3 and should be for other families of 3-4 seeking a 2BR 2BA."
34809262,527688355,2019-09-11,103153557,Mansour,"Amazing host, and great location! The house is extremely clean and host is amazing!"

34809262,544133507,2019-10-09,284658864,Emily Z,Me and my parents had a very comfortable stay at Darby’s. Everything is clean and tidy and there is plenty of space for three people to live. And Darby is nice and quick to respond.

35091103,529050795,2019-09-14,46352487,Jenny,"The flat is about 10-15 minutes walk from Victoria station. Exit Wilton road. The flat is on the 3rd level with no lift. There is no shampoo, conditioner or body soap. The bed sheet, towels and duvet were very luxurious. The flat has no fan for the warm weather but it has floor heating, ideal for winter. The flat has 2 bedrooms but 1 of them faces the main road and is very noisy. The TV in the bedrooms don’t work. Only the one in the living room do. The fridge doesn’t close nicely and there is no chopping board. Otherwise the cutlery and utensils are adequate. <br/>Only 1 roll of toilet paper for our 10 days stay and we had to go out to buy more."
35091103,537206641,2019-09-28,57933644,Craig,Flat was exactly as described.  Clean and a great location.  One review had mentioned the street was noisy but with the windows closed I did not hear any road traffic whatsoever.  All questions were answered promptly
35091103,544954702,2019-10-11,228500135,Denia,"This apartment is amazing. the bed is very comfortable. they have heater so we didnt feel cold. check in and check out was easy. Even laura send Abdul to help me check in thanks a lot! The location is great. near victoria and pimlico station. I’d love to stay in this apartment if i had a chance to visit London again! but the thing is, the room is located in 2/3 floor need a little effort to take our luggage but its worth it :)"
35091103,553472709,2019-10-24,298585273,Pieter,"This is an amazing apartment. Everything looks nice, it has all the comforts of home and the beds are so soft! We had some problems with the check in, but the helpful Abdul and the quality of the apartment more than made up for it. The location is also very central."
35091103,561413402,2019-11-09,34607737,Paul,"The flat location is spot on and the underground is only 5<br/>mins walk. Well speced space, nice touches supplied by the host. Laura is a great host. I highly recommend Laura and the flat."
35091103,565360111,2019-11-17,72192679,Kevin,"Laura’s place was very clean and definitely worth spending the money on.  The place was spacious, enough room for 3 people (+1 on the couch).  I appreciated the washer/dryer unit although we didn’t use it.  There’s only one tv antenna, so you’ll have to share watching tv between the bedrooms - and looks like someone took one of the two AAA batteries from one of the remotes.  You’ll also want to be sure to possibly adjust the heat to your preference.  I would definitely stay here again tho!"
35091103,568453321,2019-11-24,214175728,Magd,Laura's place was outstanding as far as location and the apartment itself. It was very easy checking in and out too. Would definitely recommend it to anyone
35091103,571464060,2019-12-01,244395732,Jordayn,"This place was perfect for me and my friend. It was super cute and looked exactly like the photo. The only issue we had was my fault I couldn't find the address on the building. The place had all the utilities you would need, beds were amazing, and the towels were huge and really soft. If I come back to London I would stay there again."

35160480,480309897,2019-07-02,30130601,Nadia,"It's so much better than we expected. The train station is just a few mins away by foot. We mainly used ride sharing services to get to the city centre. It costs around 17 to 18 pounds. The convenience store is just across the street, so if you love cooking it's so easy. The kitchen is a chef's dream. The house is clean, well equipped and there's a user manual so you have everything you need to know. Dan and Carly left us bubbly, beers, eggs and bread and we were so thankful for that. Would definitely recommend their place if you want somewhere affordable and comfortable to stay just outside the city center. We absolutely love chilling at home watching Netflix and playing the xbox after a long day. The patio is perfect for the four of us. We would definitely stay at their place if we ever come to London again. This is my first airbnb experience and it's been amazing. Thank you."
35160480,551566880,2019-10-20,75073842,Jennifer,"Genuinely lovely host, left me a bottle of Prosecco for my birthday in the fridge for when I arrived and a welcoming note which was a nice surprise. The entire place is very stylish and clean, had all the amenities needed and felt very homely. The host also kept in contact and gave fast replies, I honestly can't fault my experience and would stay there again!"
35160480,566408779,2019-11-19,14326939,Laura,"Best kept secret in London. Bright & welcoming. One stop off of the London Bridge train station. Easy access to groceries, restaurants, pubs and more. Very clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend for friends, a couple or a family. Perfect place to spend your Christmas holidays. Make yourself at home in London and live like a local in New Cross."

Dan answered our questions very quickly, we had no problems in communication. He left is a bottle of wine and snacks, it was very sweet of him. Apartment located not in centre, but it was easy to get everywhere we wanted. Highly recommend this apartment and Dan add host:)"

Provide a nice and clean accomodation with own bathroom, which is close to public transport (tube, railway, bus). Communicate fair minded,  fast, precise and support if needed. Good luck, we got it with Derricks flat."

36342516,490337312,2019-07-18,269184187,Pierre,"It is a lovely apartment in an elegant area. Easily accessible through all modes, Earls court Underground station (Piccadilly and District lines) is a 8-10 min walk, the bus station is at the corner and Uber/taxi rates were very affordable from/to central London. The host is very professional and reliable, all my queries were promptly answered and solved. The apartment has all amenities you might need for a short or long stay. It is located on the 5th floor, which gives a better view from the windows from 2 sides, however the elevator was out of order during our stay."
36342516,504742740,2019-08-08,52891923,Tim,Not a bad place to stay but being on the top floor of the serviced apartment building with 110+ fairly steep steps to climb and no lift operating for the week we were there made it a chore coming and going. Otherwise no real problems.

Vicinato tranquillo, quartiere sicuro ed elegante.<br/>Posizione centrale, si possono raggiungere a piedi  i migliori supermercati per fare la spesa, i negozi e musei. Noi ne abbiamo approfittato per cenare sempre a casa. Peccato che la lavastoviglie non funzionava. Wi-Fi super veloce. Per noi, è  stato un soggiorno perfetto. Ringraziamo Stephanie e il suo staff che sono stati molto disponibili e rapidi  a soddisfare ogni nostra richiesta e gentilissimi anche nell’averci  consentito di poter lasciare i bagagli a casa oltre l’orario del check out.  Consigliatissimo!"
36342516,523804052,2019-09-04,49765165,Duncan,"I really wanted to give this a 3.5 but that's not an option. There is a lot to like about this apartment - the location in Kensington (short walks to Earls Court and High St Ken tube stations), the view, the modern finishings, how clean it was, comfortable beds but unfortunately there were a few things that let it down for us and one in particular impacted the first couple of days of our stay.<br/><br/>The apartment is on the 5th (top) floor which we knew about when booking and this itself wasn't a problem but the lift was broken when we arrived and it didn't get fixed properly until the evening of the second day. We were travelling with a baby and a toddler plus a large amount of luggage, car seats, stroller etc so having to carry all of this up 5 floors was a major for us. It also limited our stay as my partner couldn't leave the apartment with both kids when I had to go and drop off the car back to the rental place. We were in contact with both the rental agency and the owner and got slightly different responses from them re the lift repair work. A neighbour told us the lift often breaks so is a known issue which we believe we should have been warned about. If stair climbing isn't an issue for you, then great but for us it was.<br/><br/>Some other minor things: there is no microwave, the dishwasher doesn't work well, the dryer function of the washer dryer didn't work for us and a frypan was provided that didn't work with the induction stove top. None of these are majors but added up for us."
36342516,536791520,2019-09-27,3575811,Amie,"This flat met our needs during our week in London. The neighborhood is safe, clean, and quiet in the evenings and at night. It gets busy during rush hour but street noise is minimal on the top floor of the building. The flat itself is minimal but adequate, very clean, and quiet. The location is great for exploring central London. Easy walk to the Underground in multiple directions. Easy access to cabs and buses nearby as well. The beds were very comfortable and the towels were amazing. Nice views from the flat as well. We didn't cook any meals in the flat, so I can't comment on the kitchen setup. The lift did go out for a few days during our stay, but the host worked diligently to get it back up and running as quickly as possible which was appreciated. There are a lot of stairs, and I was thankful the lift was working on the days I needed to take my luggage up and down. There is nice closet space in both the bedrooms and drawers available as well which helped us settle in a bit more for our stay. Mirrors throughout made it easy to get ready in different spaces without taking up too much time in the bathroom. The bathroom was very clean and has a nice shower. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
36342516,544941062,2019-10-11,166104739,Sanchit,"This is a beautiful apartment in an elegant and upmarket suburb. We were very impressed with the location, cleanliness and amenities provided at this apartment. It is at an extremely convenient location for buses, trains and sightseeing around the palaces. We travelled by train a fair bit coming in through Earl's Court and High Street Kensington stations, as well as Uber. The tube stations mentioned are around a 6-10 minutes walk from the apartment and it is easy to get to Central London from the apartment. The hosts were very helpful and professional and addressed all queries promptly. The apartment has an excellent kitchen and the two bedrooms are comfortable for a longer stay as well. It is located on the 5th floor and has some nice views. The elevator was not operating for two days during our stay so you may need to climb stairs to get to it, which may be an issue for some. Their recommendations were also great, since we tried some of the restaurants they recommended and enjoyed them. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place. If I had to book again and stay here, I definitely would!"

No conocimos a Hong pero Nadia nos recibió muy amablemente y pudimos dejar las maletas hasta que nos fuimos al aeropuerto cosa que ayudó mucho. Parada de bus a 2 minutos que te lleva directamente al centro. La parada de metro está a 20 minutos caminando aprox. El único pero es que durante nuestra estancia el ascensor estuvo estropeado así que todos los días teníamos que subir y bajar a un quinto piso. Por lo demás todo fenomenal! Muy recomendable!"

36371745,431694180126440874,2021-08-18,42121351,Clare,"Fantastic place to stay in London. The flat was quiet, the beds were comfy and the location was great to get into central London. Communication with Hong and Nadia was always fast, and they kindly let us leave our car in their parking space on the day of check out. Would stay here again."
36371745,464986663149283717,2021-10-03,372688421,Adelle,"Hong's place was a great place to stay, very central, well maintained and communication was brilliant.  We would recommend and would stay again."

36371745,483850528850138529,2021-10-29,66322314,Hanna,"Very comfortable apartment, clean and practical with great views. The host was easily accessible and helpful. We spent a nice few days of family vacation wondering about London. It was easy to find brunch and dinner places on Kings Road. Only the metro station could have been a little closer to the station but on the other hand there were several buses to the center. Strong recommendation!"
36371745,485362654796140301,2021-10-31,260005098,Emily,"Well-equipped apartment, lovely hosts and great location! Looks exactly like the photos."

Communication with Hong was really easy and helpful. <br/><br/>The location is super handy for exploring Chelsea and the Kings road and simple to get into central London by bus or tube.

Lee met me at the door as I arrived. The room was clean, tidy and provided me with the facilities that I needed.  A lovely extra touch I very rarely get is a kettle with some tea, coffee and small snack. The bed was comfortable and the house was quiet.  All in all, an excellent stay and I'm so grateful for lee's hospitality."

A cosy room in a peaceful area, with quick and easy access to anything you could possibly need from cafés to shops, and also with easy access to public transport towards central London."

Super comfortable bed, great room, super clean, warm, and such kind touch to leave a bottle of water, coffee/tea, crisps, little chocholate to have with a coffee. I enjoyed staying and would highly recommend  this place.  Thank you, Lee."

The room and bathroom were very clean and there were little treats, water, coffee and tea in the room :) Close to Kingsbury train station and main street, about 45-60 min journey to central and close to bus stops.  Just wish the mattress was a bit softer. Thank you Lee !"
36388955,616686659,2020-03-10,67438247,Marga,"Nice bedroom in a family house; i think it is a daughter's room.<br/>The rooms are very close together, so is feels a little intrusive.<br/>Good value for money."
36422198,487830748,2019-07-14,303007,George,"Fabulous host,very helpful. Flat was spotless,nice to have a washing machine, some don't. Very central and handy for shops and travel. A pleasure  to stay,didn't want to leave!"

36511631,519407787,2019-08-28,27070928,Tabriz,"The apartment is in a great neighborhood, centrally located and safe. Kamal and his assistant are very professional, and they made the check in and check out process smooth and easy. The apartment is also kept very clean, making it a very comfortable and pleasant stay."
36511631,542268534,2019-10-06,117653690,Ariella,"I got to the flat before the host did, eventhough he booked a time for us to meet- if i were to be late he would have given me a penalty. I somehow managed to enter the flat and the building without him being around. (Other airbnb guest helped me in and told me that the communication with the host and his assistences are not coordinated). <br/>The toilet flush didnt work in the evenings/night- beware. The front doornobe comes out when you push open. Hot water didnt work on the last day- couldnt take a shower before leaving.<br/>Its a cheap price- you might be getting what your paying for.<br/>I booked a slitly more expensive room for my next trip(Next month) to London."
36511631,552275810,2019-10-21,184722094,Julie,"Doesn’t look like much from the outside, but the people were friendly and the area is safe. Accommodations were perfect. Room had a view of the city skyline from the 6th floor (There is an elevator). There was afternoon that it didn’t work, but it was fixed by the next day. Markets and tourist attractions are all walkable."
36511631,553889340,2019-10-25,190984253,Benjamin,The place was very nice and neat.
36511631,555115648,2019-10-27,299469834,Natalie,"The check-in process was very fast, I arrived early and it only took a few minutes for Hussain to arrive and greet me, he showed me around the flat and my room and was very efficient. He was very nice.<br/><br/>The room was clean, and is actually much larger than the photos show. The flat has a kitchen with a stove, microwave, kettle and clean dishes.<br/><br/>The other guests were very respectful and quiet. I would happily book this room again!"

36511631,573797605,2019-12-07,235962207,Yihang,位置无敌，离伦敦金融城就隔着几条街。如果来伦敦出差几天并想省钱的话可以选择。房间还算干净整洁，最大的问题是淋浴间卫生有点凑合。房东的服务还不错。住的那天晚上暖气出了问题，即使很晚了他们也派人来修。
36511631,578940762,2019-12-19,64790151,Michael,Second time staying and as before it offers everything that is needed for a short stay in the city centre. Perfect for my work trip to London.
36511631,584536479,2019-12-30,250796614,Francis,"Kamal's place is well located, within walking distance of Liverpool Street, Brick Lane and Shoreditch, with plenty of tubes and buses to get into central London. Flat is clean, and very quiet."

Btw: Airbnb might let you select an earlier check in time, but read the description down at the bottom rather than select."

36511631,645619164,2020-08-02,40195098,Matt,"Nice room, with a good view of London. Room is bigger than the photos make out and doesn't do it justice. Good value for money considering how close it is to the city."
36511631,663191067,2020-09-12,20346321,Christian,"Very convenient location with good views. The host,  Kamal, is very friendly and responds quickly to any questions."

36511631,708133759,2020-11-11,109003824,Armağan Ahmet,Very good location and very close to the center! There are markets around. You will not have a heat problem in your room. Internet speed is sufficient for simple tasks. Kitchen and shower are adequate. I recommend it in terms of price-performance. Kamal is very nice and has been very helpful. Thank you so much!

36511631,458438152328333419,2021-09-24,20346321,Christian,Basic room in great location. Very responsive host. Recommended.
36511631,475141938653167500,2021-10-17,258930749,Michelle,"Great stay if you just need somewhere to sleep during your stay in London. <br/>Pros: Reasonable price. Nothing too fancy but definitely clean apartment and room. Strong WiFi. Quiet apartment. Nice window view. Room has table, chair, and lampshade. Towel, fan, hangers, and extra blanket (in addition to the duvet) were provided. There are toilet paper and hand wash provided. Kitchen has fridge and microwave. Quick responses of Host (Kamal) and the Caretaker (Hussein). Friendly welcome. Tour of the apartment facilities provided. Accessible location for commute (10-15 minutes walk to/from public transpo). Secure building. Nice view on the balcony outside the apartment unit. Nice Turkish takeaways around the area.<br/>Cons: Tricky shower -- either the water is too cold or too hot -- difficult to find the perfect warm temperature (tip to future guests: it's not in the middle, it's somewhere on the left at 07:00 angle, you need to move it for 1 or 2 millimeters and check first until you find that perfect angle). Bathroom sink I think was clogged since the water fills up and takes time to go down. The room smells like cigarettes -- I smoked myself but I did it outside the apartment on the balcony -- perhaps a deep scrub of the room and make it a rule that guests should not smoke inside the room. <br/>Note: I cannot comment on safety since I just walked around the neighbourhood on my first afternoon and took the taxi most of my stay. Though I noticed there are some alleys you need to walk through to get to the apartment complex that there not so much people to none and no establishments. But other than that it was okay. <br/>Overall, it was a pleasant stay! I would recommend Kamal's place! And I would stay in this room again if I come back to London and need a place!"
36511631,483133968940793417,2021-10-28,12960347,Simon,"The room and apartment were great - clean, tidy and fully stocked with everything I needed. It's in the ideal location for me, and was great value for money."

36511631,505671817363132576,2021-11-28,427928901,Jade,"What you should know it's the mattress isn't really comfy but if you stay just few days, you'll like the emplacement. You're close to everything with the underground, it's a good choice to stay if you are on your own in London."
36751651,500492477,2019-08-02,104272625,Alice,"Great stay, Abby is super thoughtful, the place is spotless, bed very comfy and I had a lovely stay"

36751651,519751949,2019-08-29,1671971,Inman,"Abigail’s place is about 15 mins walking distance from Brixton tube station (Victoria Line). Brixton is a very vibrant and diverse place, and you can get Japanese, Vietnamese, Caribbean, Thai food easily at Brixton Village Market. It was very easy to communicate with Abigail since she responded quickly when l have questions regarding to accommodation issues. She also let my friend stay with me for 3 nights for free. It was a good experience to stay at her place!"
36751651,532699227,2019-09-20,122094197,Mo & Zan,One word sums this up and that is “exceptional”. The host Abby was warm and friendly and went out of her way to help. Her home is lovely and spotlessly clean and is conveniently located. I would highly recommend Abby’s place
36751651,536252482,2019-09-26,67612772,Manja,Abigail is the kindest host
36751651,557092873,2019-10-31,2236871,Milda,"Perfect place in London. Not too far from the city, can always reach centre with a bus. The room was clean and perfect for one person staying, there is a big built-in wardrobe thus you will have place to keep your things. Abby always kept the place clean and was quick to respond to any questions. Would definitely recommend staying here! Thank you Abby :)"
36751651,563611433,2019-11-13,24304255,Mark,"Abigail was a great host! She was very friendly, responsive and takes wonderful care of her place. For this value the room is very comfortable with a pleasant view and the home is tastefully furnished. I would stay again when I return to London."
36751651,567777570,2019-11-23,4651179,Sven,"Sehr schöne Unterkunft zu einem tollen Preis. Abigail ist sehr freundlich und kommunikativ. Das Zimmer ist klein aber ausreichend. Auch wenn man bisschen laufen muß bis zur Tube würde ich hier wieder buchen. Je nach dem in welche Richtung man will, ist der Bus fast um die Ecke."
36751651,578934653,2019-12-19,101123281,Sandie,"I stayed 3 weeks at Agigail's and really felt at home as soon as I arrived. Abigail is very nice, she always asks you how you are and if there is anything you need. <br/>The house is very clean and my towels and bed linnen were often changed. Nothing bad to say about this place ! I highly recommend !!"
36751651,604972697,2020-02-13,184407893,Anagha,"Abigail is an awesome host. She is super helpful, made me feel right at home  and gave excellent tips on staying in London as a first -timer. Her place is very accessible to buses/subway stations / shops. I couldn't have asked for a better host and highly recommend her place for your stay in London. Cheers!"
36845963,509101998,2019-08-14,2231664,Andrew,The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
36845963,512496916,2019-08-18,4621552,Najet,Andrew was a great host. His flat is located in a great area. He has an amazing terrace with a nice view. I will come back. Thank you Andrew for the lovely stay.
36845963,570843803,2019-11-30,264895572,Gino,"Andrew was very attentive and always replied quickly to my messages. The location is incredible and the roof terrace magical! It's a small, cosy flat which has everything you need. Definitly would stay here again."
36845963,701098102,2020-10-17,56730129,Stan,Great place - the current pictures don't do it justice. Stylish and plenty of rooms and spaces. The huge rooftop deck is unique and I really made use of it regularly for Yoga and relaxing. Andrew was a great host - communicative and able to find solutions even to unforeseen events like the mobile wifi Internet being down across all operators for an upgrade to 5G. <br/>The area is great - many restaurants and super markets right next to Nothing Hill Gate tube stop. <br/>If you find this place available it is definitely a great one!
36905869,670949610,2020-10-04,203305211,Korina,"The room was beautiful and very clean. Extraordinary Kommunikation! I arrived much earlier than the check in time (8am) and it still was no problem to check in. <br/>The reception is open 24/7 and very kind - also they will help you with any requests (they provided me with forks/ knifes, a hair dryer and they also printed out boarding tickets for me). The Train stations are all nearby - Oxford street is within just a few minutes of walking distance (ca. 10 min). I highly recommend this place if you want to enjoy your trip to London and still be central. Thank you very much OYO team :)"
37119764,528644612,2019-09-13,27660729,Gary,The location is better than I could have asked for.  2 minute walk from the train station which makes commuting around the city a breeze!

37119764,549452450,2019-10-18,265378698,Daphne,The location and neighborhood are great! The room has everything you need
37119764,561405693,2019-11-09,18761926,Iman,"This Airbnb is actually run by a company and there are about 9 rooms being rented at a time, so you should consider this if you are searching for an authentic Airbnb experience and not a dormitory feel. There are two bathrooms so it becomes complicated with all the other guests. There is no kitchen so I wouldn’t suggest more than a two night stay. As we stayed for 5 days we requested new towels as it wasn’t possible to do laundry, and the response from the housekeeper was that the company said we’d have to request through email and the said we must pay...very impersonal experience. We couldn’t even leave our luggage for 2 hours after checkout. Next time I would definitely find an authentic Airbnb in London, not a corporate version. It’s in a fantastic area though, plenty of restaurants and underground nearby. Very clean also."
37119764,566437953,2019-11-19,38321836,Valentina,"We had a great time in London! Also thanks to the beautiful location of Veronica, super central and near the metro station! The house is so pretty and Veronica reply so quickly if you write her. Absolutely recommended!"
37119764,570764379,2019-11-30,116471937,Sheron,"The host was kind in allowing us to have an early check in, checking in was very easy and the place was very clean. The room seemed smaller than expected but cosy. Sufficient lighting and plug points provided. Plenty of hot water for all day use. Our only disappointment was no kitchen use and the shower stall was quite tight. Large or claustrophobic person will have issues. <br/>Two tube stations were reasonably close. Best choice would be Warren St. which was easier with connections. There's a Pizza Express, Pret a Manger, small restaurants, Mc Donalds and pubs nearby. A Tesco local next to the tube station for convenience."
37119764,572827016,2019-12-04,54842307,Tom,The bedroom door was broken which made it hard to close and there was gap showing so not totally secure.
37119764,575118344,2019-12-09,299069845,Stephanie,Great location perfect if you are wanting to tour London as only a short walk away from the nearest tube station. Communication was great and the host very helpful!
37119764,577994022,2019-12-16,178017672,Margaretha,"The apartment, in a centrally located townhouse, is very fresh and clean. New beds and bedding and quiet surroundings provide a nice night's sleep. Close to public transport (2 metro stations within 10 minutes walk) but also possible to walk to Oxford Circus etc. I can highly recommend this accommodation and the only thing I missed was a mirror and a hook in the room - but that's just a detail (I was aware that there is no kitchen available - but there are many nice cafes around the corner). Veronica is easy to communicate with and she responds quickly to questions. I will keep this place in my mind - and return - and has already recommended it to many friends."
37119764,578617054,2019-12-18,52250070,Sharon,"The room was very clean. It was all that you need for a night’s rest, albeit a bit small for 2 people with 2 big luggages. notwithstanding, the location of place was very convenient. Veronica was also exceptionally quick to respond to my queries and was very accommodating."
37289182,528105723,2019-09-12,61269935,Chuck,Eduardo’s place was great for us!  It was only a 5 minute walk to Buckingham palace and 10 minutes to the Victoria train station.  It was very clean and had a washer / dryer that was great since we were traveling to several cities.  Eduardo met us early to drop our bags on early arrival to city  and also had coffee and tea for our use. He was also very helpful  with my phone and getting it to work in UK.   I would recommend to anyone traveling to see the highlights of London.
37289182,574585873,2019-12-08,303061541,Michael,Was an amazing place. Exactly what it looks like. Eduardo is a great host and will take care of you with any issues immediately. Perfect location.

37391328,515129523,2019-08-22,45464712,S Courtney,"Sonder (London) is a well appointed and styled apartment. The staff is very responsive and always seek to meet your needs. If you need a location in the City, I recommend Sonder (London)."
37391328,538865655,2019-09-30,18369846,Lucas,"So I’ve stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s. I love to travel, and finding a nice place to stay is not always easy. I can easily tell you, this was the most elegant, beautiful Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. From the ease of check in, to the modern sleek look, to the view from the balcony, I absolutely loved staying here. When we walked in, our mouths dropped. <br/>Thank you so much for making our time in London so special. It was hard to leave the apartment sometimes because we just wanted to stay there."

37391328,607503910,2020-02-17,333669356,Nina,The host canceled this reservation 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
37391328,612880275,2020-03-01,324579581,Toby,The apartment was superb and well equipped. We had an issue with the locking mechanism on bed 1 door which kept blowing open through the first night. The next morning we were told how to correct the problem. This spoilt our first night's sleep but otherwise we would strongly recommend renting this apartment.

37495153,668071689,2020-09-26,261559555,Sagda,"Elda was a great host, she was very lovely from the very  beginning. The communication between us was immaculate which reassured me as it was my first time travelling/staying by myself. When I arrived she was very welcoming and made me feel like I was at home, offered me coffee and her personality overall speaks volumes. The house was very clean and the room was bigger than I had anticipated. The location is very convenient especially if you're travelling by transport, it took me 11 minutes to get to Stratford Westfield from St Pancreas Intl which is a 4 minute walk from Kings Cross station. Lastly, Wesfield shopping centre is a 5 minutes walk from the apartment. I felt very safe in the area and I would recommend staying in this place."
37495153,670450802,2020-10-03,234616803,Shada,"Nice place and good host ,."

I had everything at my fingertips, and it was a great location, and close to all of the essential shops.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there."
37495153,744254966,2021-04-01,246232770,Yves,Fantastic host and good self catered amenities. Stayed here for a work visit but would recommend for any occasion

37495153,440354262317231603,2021-08-30,100342305,Prithvi,"Checkin on Airbnb was mentioned as 11. But Elda told us to check in only at 1. And even after that she was late and made us wait. The entire apartment was very dirty and not clean. There were loads of cigarette butts and broken things in the balcony. Also we thought the host will be staying in the other room on the property, but instead she let out her room and she has another flatmate who stays in the other room. He’s extremely dirty, doesn’t clean up the dishes after he’s done nor does he empty the trash. The location is spot on and the building is posh. But considering everything else it was a bad experience and definitely overpriced."
37495153,459955601552784656,2021-09-26,297586924,Haaris,Had a great stay at this Air BnB. The bedroom and ensuite were spacious and clean and there was access to all necessary amenities. It was really great value for money. Unfortunately I had misplaced the key during my stay but Elda was a great host. She was really patient and understanding and was able to arrange for us to still have access to the room. Could not have thanked her enough and would definitely recommend staying here.

Bobby is also a wonderful host. He is flexible, friendly and charming. He was wonderful enough to let me check in earlier than planned. I had a pleasant stay overall."
37515487,514042784,2019-08-20,36391308,Mariana,A quiet place to spend time in London.

Completely perfect stay in Bobby’s lovely home, cannot say a bad word and happy to say we have made a new friend in London :)"

37515487,539909298,2019-10-02,45871674,James,"Bobby is a nice guy, the bed was very comfortable and the location was very quiet.<br/>The kitchen really was messy and dirty making it difficult to prepare anything and there is no shower curtain or screen making showers challenging and resulting in water all over the floor.<br/>A few improvements and it would be a cracking little place to stop."
37515487,540886705,2019-10-04,2197061,Paul,"Great location, with tube, buses very close by. <br/>A short walk into Kensal Green for shops and places to eat.<br/>Very reasonably priced.<br/>Bobby is very welcoming."
37515487,542155616,2019-10-06,154856882,Pamela,Bobby was such a great host and so understanding! He was so helpful with tips on where to go and where to visit. I have used Airbnb a few times before but this location was just great! The bus stops and the underground were about 3 minutes away which was great for me partner and I for our first time in London!  Thank you so much Bobby! We hope to be back soon.
37515487,543181079,2019-10-07,183519122,Sebastiaan,"Great guy, super friendly and helpful. Would stay here again"
37515487,544141995,2019-10-09,37640345,Odette,"Was unclean (previous guests had brought a dog unannounced and there was fur still in room, common area coffee table was very unclean) and key had been lost so door was left unlocked which felt insecure, a long bus ride from Victoria and central areas"
37515487,544865742,2019-10-11,166740881,Nate,Bobby is an awesome guy. Really laid back and always willing to help. The space itself is very relaxing and it's great value for money. <br/><br/>Note for wheelchair users like myself: Bobby has done very well to accommodate for disabled access but the ramp to the property is steep and there is a 3-inch lip of the doorframe to contend with.  If you've got good balance and chair skills you should be fine and Bobby will help. The bath is very high so that might be a problem for some. <br/><br/>I look forward to coming back when I need a stop-off for London Town!
37515487,548357579,2019-10-17,122120676,Albert,Bobby is a friendly host. The location of the property was great. Close to all amenities and transport
37515487,551354656,2019-10-20,101109714,Rachel,My girlfriend and I had a few packed days of tourist-y things planned so we were looking for a comfortable and affordable to crash with parking and that’s what we got! The bed was comfortable and Bobby was quick with responding and his place is a very short walk to the overground station. We checked in late and left early to see some sights!
37515487,552343725,2019-10-21,50058675,Nick,"Bobby is an extremely helpful lad who helped throughout my entire 1-night stay (last minute). The unit is described to the best possible means, though there were a few issues when I arrived. It may seem as though his cleaner had not cleaned the unit properly when I arrived at 6 pm. There also was not TP and shower was not functional/broken. The bathroom was also a bit dirty after staying at Airbnbs across the world. Again, I don't normally complain--and before I woke up Bobby began trying to rectify all the issues with the handyman. Again, he is an extremely helpful lad, tries his best, and is a decent rate for budget accommodation. If you are a neat-freak and fret over several minor cleaning omissions, then maybe search elsewhere. The ~38 pounds per night is also a decent rate, but probably would not stay again or let my spouse stay."
37515487,553097349,2019-10-23,110442435,Stuart,"Bobby’s place was very comfortable, great location near Kensal Rise with excellent transport links and restaurants!"

37515487,557556072,2019-11-01,28465859,Antoine,"Appartement not clean, Bonny was nice but he was more than 2 hours late and communication was difficult, the room wasn’t clean before arrival ( even though we have booked 2 days before and we were arriving at 9pm ! ) , bathroom was disgusting and commun area were not properly maintain .... totally overpriced, I wouldn’t recommend !"
37515487,558724833,2019-11-03,41346895,Shaheda,"Good location, close to overground. Bobby was a good host, very friendly."
37515487,561010141,2019-11-08,50592876,Samantha,"Unfortunately, I was five minutes  away from Bobby's airbnb (twenty minutes past our arranged check in time) when he messaged to explain that the room wasnt ready (sheets weren't on the bed, room and floor wasnt cleaned) and he wouldn't be home to receive me in person (as previously arranged) for another forty-five minutes.  As a consequence of a few things I didn't stay there. <br/>Bobby was very apologetic about the room and his not being available."
37515487,561378410,2019-11-09,62369619,Anthea,Bobby is a great host and very accommodating! The location is close to transport so getting in and out of the city is nice and easy!

37515487,569353297,2019-11-26,221585525,Nuria,"No hay cerrojo en la habitación eramos dos mujeres y alguna noche a nuestras llegada Bobby estaba con algún amigo, muy respetuosos, pero con cerrojo mejor. El baño está fuera de la habitación, no sabemos si era privado o no. Cada uno en su casa vive como quiere, pero cuando tienes inquilinos la limpieza es importante y recoger los restos de la cena antes de acostarse también. No puso la calefacción, en el baño hacía mucho frío para ducharse por las mañanas, ni un radiador. No puso gel ni champú y WiFi no sabemos si había, no nos lo ofreció. Secador de pelo tampoco tiene. Las telarañas de la habitación se traducen en una gran falta de limpieza que además nos cobro en la tarifa del alquiler. Ya llevábamos nuestra ruta de visita hecha por suerte, porque no nos ofrecio información sobre sitios para visita o cosas típicas de Londres como si nos ha pasado en otros países. Me resultó muy caro para lo que ofrecio"
37515487,570856178,2019-11-30,145360463,Sami,Bobby's place was in a safe neighborhood with convenient access to transit. He provided easy checkin and great advice to first time London visitors. <br/><br/>Overall cleanliness was not the best. Likely because it was a last minute booking and Bobby was under the weather.  Wifi was choppy. <br/><br/>Having free parking was a plus.
37515487,573880513,2019-12-07,74219326,Kristin,Bobby’s place was just perfect for a quick overnight stay awaiting our flight home.

37654863,556405661,2019-10-29,286683488,Seth,Tim’s home has definitely been the best Airbnb  I have stayed at! He was very quick at responding and made sure to answer any bit of question we had. You can definitely tell that Tim cares for his guests! :) His place was beautiful and located in the perfect place. Not too far from central London and you could walk pretty much anywhere you needed to from his home. His home was honestly such a positive place to be at that we did not want to leave. So warm and cozy. The home was clean and had everything we needed. Thank you Tim for a beautiful stay. Would love to come back !
37654863,560562884,2019-11-07,3056144,Dani,"It's best to be prepared for a little walk from the nearest underground station, especially with luggage. Aside from that, it truly is a perfect little home away from home! Tim is super responsive even from the other side of the world, and so friendly. The flat is cosy and stylish and has an amazing bath. Everything is comfortable and homey. It's not a sterile holiday let, but Tim is sharing his actual home, which is what Airbnb is about for me. The place is an inspirational poster come to life, so I felt super positive all the time =) a lovely place to stay in London, for sure. Thank you!"
37654863,766055229,2021-06-04,341576120,Jacqueline,I hope to continue next time.
37654863,399016842155929536,2021-07-04,54833678,Chun Wai,I had stayed in this flat for a month. The flat is clean and well appointed. A few minutes commute from the tube station. The host is helpful and responsive. Definitely deserve a five-star!
37654863,413543373399122503,2021-07-24,47133171,Janos,"As soon as we stepped inside Tim’s home, we felt that it was the right choice to spend our time while staying in London. We immediately felt the welcoming warmth of a real home and frankly we didn’t even want to leave it once our 10 days had passed. The flat was particularly clean, stylish with good taste, spacious enough for 2 people and really comfortable.<br/>The kitchen is well equipped, we gladly spent the majority of our time there. If one is fortunate enough with the not always merciful weather of London, make sure to try the balcony for breakfasts (excellent amount of sunshine!) and warm nights. The neighbourhood is safe and clean, easy to approach.<br/>Tim was at our service at any given time with no delay, I have to admit he put the original magic back into AirBNB, which I thought was lost a long time ago.<br/>We would gladly recommend this home-away-from-home to you without a doubt, however that way our chances would decline significantly to be able to rent the this home again.<br/>Thank you!"

37671964,555972423,2019-10-28,193755023,Anne,This was our first time to London and staying here helped us feel like we were both at home and locals.   We could easily used public transportation and saw everything we could during our stay.   Martin has a well equipped kitchen and we took advantage of that for most breakfasts and a couple of dinners.   We also explored some local pubs and had an excellent experience there too.   Martin responded quickly and made check in and check out easy for us.  We enthusiastically recommend Martin and his place.
37671964,575783004,2019-12-11,32778660,Terran,"This was a great space for my friend and I to spend a week in London. Really great value.  It was walking distance to Brick Lane Sunday market and Spitalfields and a quick walk to the tube, so easy to get around. The train that runs by the building was quite loud but we brought ear plugs and honestly got used to it by the second night (it doesn't run overnight). Communication was clear and check-in was easy."

38660643,727921489,2021-01-31,248188159,Linda,"Overall, great stay. Charme allowed us to have our cats with us for a month stay and it was very much appreciated. The location is epic though with that, comes a bit of noise from the streets at night but that's to be expected.<br/><br/>It was well cleaned but there's definitely some room for improvement as the carpets were getting pretty dingy. It's a very old flat but quite cool and we were comfortable.<br/><br/>I've deducted a star mainly around the fact that there's no WiFi set up in the flat and we had to connect to the restaurant next door. The signal was awful and we had to buy an extender to have a fast enough speed for calls. Also, communication, though very friendly and prompt was limited around procedures to check in and get WiFi passwords etc.<br/><br/>I would say with a few improvements that the cost of the place would be worth it. Overall I'd recommend it."

38660643,486079891127056892,2021-11-01,50131925,Anne,"We had a great time in this charming little house in the heart of Notting Hill. Great restaurants near by, a lovely atmosphere all around, all the family really enjoyed very much this long week end!"
38660643,491088159022566235,2021-11-08,6847582,Sarah,"This spacious flat is close to the tube and is in a neighborhood with lots of charming restaurants and pubs. It was a little under equipped and could have been cleaner, but the hosts were generous with respect to our check in."
38721646,591915449,2020-01-12,117230788,Fiona,We had a very Nice stay at Jo’s! The flat is very confortable and well decorated !
38768497,543179905,2019-10-07,297057832,Kayla,"This place was perfect for a quick weekend away in London. Only a short bus ride into the city, or a longer walk if thats what you prefer. Very close to King's Cross station as well for trains."
38768497,544937557,2019-10-11,155611014,Joshua,"Amazing value for money. Good location, only a 15min walk from Camden and only 10mins from either Tuffnell Park station or Caledonian Road station. Very clean also."
38768497,551451769,2019-10-20,86160821,Emma,"Great stay, lovely and very patient host. Really clean. Had a great shower. Perfect for getting the bus into the centre. Totally quiet. NB to leave the bedroom you need to walk through the little spare room where the sofa bed is so it doesn't get much privacy. The sofa bed is a bit small - one to share between a couple only. We really liked this place and would stay there again."
38768497,555123419,2019-10-27,80502753,Sirio,"Nice location, clean and Mahir answers really fast every time you have some questions. some things can be improved but at this price it's perfect for a weekend in London."
38768497,561996786,2019-11-10,212219726,Roderick,"Apartment is affordable, newly refreshed and clean. Has basic amenities needed, but could use a dryer to compliment washing machine. Spacious with a bedroom and dining furniture, as well as a guest room with couch.<br/><br/>Location is bit ugly at night, but staying alert is all you need. Also being close to street there is much street noise that be heard, but fixed with some well insulated doors, decorative touches, etc. <br/><br/>Mahir was a great host that answered any questions I may have had very quickly. Overall a good place to stay for the price, but I have stayed at other BnBs in this range that have offered more."
38768497,563890964,2019-11-14,6714253,Gilles,It was a pleasure and a very Nice stay.
38768497,565986294,2019-11-18,52230961,Stella Maris,"We were 3 guests. We had a good stay during a weekend. The apartment is very clean and has basic needs. Very close to Camden Town. The apartment could be a bit noisy. Mahir was a great host, he responsed all questions very quickly!  Thanks!"
38768497,566678239,2019-11-20,101318133,Tom,"Clean and tidy, but a bit noisy in the morning."
38768497,577239852,2019-12-15,299278480,Musab,"The location is not bad and the condition of the place is ok. The two bedrooms aren’t two bedrooms, they are one bedroom and one living room with a sofa bed, through which you have to pass to go to the toilet from the actual bedroom. The sofa bed sheets weren’t done, so you have to make your own bed even if you say you are 4 coming. The water we couldn’t get to stay always warm/hot, even after the host’s instruction, so we had to handle freezing cold and boiling hot whilst showering. No bin in the toilet, which for girls makes it incredibly inconvenient. Even with the blinds, there is light creeks so if you like complete darkness, not the best. No information about wifi or how to set up the water, which would have been easier in a simple sign or notebook.<br/><br/>We asked host if he could cancel when we realised the pictures were deceiving and there were actually not 2 bedrooms as described, and he was not happy (note: we did say we could cop his fee). Understand he might have been angry at us, but the general experience was not great."
38768497,583829938,2019-12-29,240070647,영휘,"축구보러왔는데, 위치가 너무 좋았고 시설도 훌륭했습니다"
38768497,592545494,2020-01-13,225193732,Gibran,Clean place! Understanding owners. Really good place to get to King cross station and or use Uber for cheap rides. I greatly recommend it!
38768497,595440646,2020-01-20,325588009,Darek,"You may not like building from outside ;) - but inside apartament was really good and clean. Fully equiped kitchen (oven, toster, wasching machine), seperate shower and toilet. One double bed and one sofa (also for two). Great location, just next to your door are shops, cafe, pizza, pub with live music, nice breakfasts. Tesco extra about 15 min by foot, metro about 20, Camden Market about 30. Owner was helpfull and fast responding. Apartament just worth it's price!"
38768497,597905430,2020-01-26,22493124,Chris,"Very clean place to stay, unfortunately the key safe box was hard to find. Bathroom a bit small but ok for 3 people. But everything was quite as we thought. We would stay there again!"
38768497,603583440,2020-02-09,26344916,Sue,"This flat was in the perfect location to catch-up with family living in the area and we used it as a base to sleep only, however it had a good kitchen so it would have been easy to cook there too if needed"

38870255,714520452,2020-12-10,41081520,Leah,"We had a lovely 1 month stay at Susan’s place while in between houses. It was a great stay and the flat is really well set up. The kitchen has everything you need for cooking proper meals (we even did a full Thanksgiving feast). The living area is snug and the TV is set up so you can log into Netflix etc easily. Suzan was a great host and always easily contactable and very responsive. Great location close to the station, tow path for walks and a large M&S within easy walking distance. Great stay. Thanks"

39023663,575469121,2019-12-10,95136007,Ariane,"Judy’s apartment is a great choice. It is located near Victoria Station, at walking distance from restaurants and stores all around. Not far from Buckingham Palace, very near Belgravia and Sloane Square.<br/>The apartment is very comfortable: a very good size bathroom (Rare in London!); the bedding in the bedrooms is excellent quality. The kitchen is not the most modern nor upscale but is enjoyable, practical and very clean. Good value for a 2 bedroom flat.<br/>Communication was excellent. <br/>Thank you!"

Yes its a basement flat, but you are within a lovely 8 min walk from Victoria and the road is so nice, quiet, and a London experience. the flat was lovely, simple and well appointed. Beds were SUPER comfy, and while we had 3 young kids with us, we never felt cramped. The Wifi was a little weak, but if you are in London for vacation, then go and explore! leave the Netflix for another day!!!<br/><br/>We loved the flat, and the location and the check in... would 100% stay again ."

The flat is tidy, very clean and well appointed with comfy beds and fluffy towels (so many places get that wrong- not here!). Very handy to public transport, close to the river for a nice walk and close to amenities, cafes, etc. The secure car parking nearby was ideal for us, too. We had an excellent stay (family of 3 with a young child) and would happily recommend it."

It seemed to be only available in tte living area of the unit. <br/>Aside of these issues, the space was comfortable, beds & bedding made for good quality rest after a hectic day."

Claudiu was responsive and helpful when we had any questions. Would definitely recommend!"
39458651,567045053,2019-11-21,8324986,Angela,London was the first stop in our trip and staying at Claudiu’s place could not have gone smoother! The apartment is in pristine condition and looks recently upgraded. Claudiu was very responsive and let us drop our luggage off early which was very helpful for us and even offered some local tips. The flat is next to the bus stop and close to the metro. It provided us with a local experience but was still close enough to the tourist things. Coffee lovers down the street was amazing! We had such a comfortable stay it spoiled us for the rest of our trip.

39859724,604440168,2020-02-11,123697054,Cheng Wen,First time staying in a dorm and enjoyed it. The location is great and public transport is just few minutes away.
39859724,608665756,2020-02-21,335066545,Matthew,Bring your own soap and shampoo. Having your own slippers would also be very handy as sometimes the toilet floor is quite dirty as people get in with their shoes on. Other than that he place is very strategic. Very close to the kensington palace and hyde park. Less than 20 mins to the city of london

40217821,580302878,2019-12-22,3015174,Jeremy,Very welcoming hosts and right next to the park.
40535423,573854290,2019-12-07,116187355,Keryn,I had a short but very sweet stay in Catrina’s home. She made me feel incredibly welcome and came to my rescue when I accidentally left a belonging in her home. Would definitely recommend!
40535423,604136622,2020-02-10,133863450,Michee,"This is my second time staying at Catrina’s place, and I will definitely be back again anytime I am visiting London. Catrina is very accommodating (allowing for flexible check in and check out) and doing small things to make the stay more comfortable and convenient. The location is great (I really love the Tooting area), and it is a good price for what you’re getting. Thanks again!"
40592348,578252927,2019-12-17,225959306,寅硕,"The place is very clean and spacious. Location is perfect. Can not ask for more if you are 5min away from an underground and train station, very convenient to central London and airports through railways. A bonus for Arsenal fans because it’s very close to a fan shop at the station and, most importantly, Emirates Stadium. Very satisfying stay. Strongly recommend."
40592348,583806431,2019-12-29,80818086,Gwi Ok,"Very close to central London, very clean and warm and the host was friendly.  I could enjoy old pop and beer in the pub downstairs.  Arsenal days are crowded, but there are no inconveniences, and the Finsbury Park station is very close, making it easy to use stores such as marts.  It is a perfect hostel with no shortage.  Strongly recommended."
40592348,586039201,2020-01-01,316535325,Sara,"Location was near to public transportation, great hospitality, very clean apartment and great value for money"

40592348,595471170,2020-01-20,107941490,Reina,The place was sparkling clean and had everything we needed. Mert was flexible with our check in time and was there on time to help us get in. The flat is very close to the underground station so it was easy to get anywhere.
40592348,596962340,2020-01-24,58668865,Ziyed,"Really good place, easy to access, near public transportation and close to center<br/>The place is also really spacious !! Would recommend 100%"
40592348,598502992,2020-01-27,7021153,David,"Mert's appartment was perfectly located for us. It's also very close to Arsenal stadium which is convenient. The apartment itself is new and very clean.<br/><br/>The place is above a pub, that wasn't a massive concern for us, but that depends on your tolerance to noise."
40592348,599818249,2020-01-31,199698545,John,"Mert's place was very clean, tastefully decorated, and amply supplied. Checking in and out were a breeze. The location was a few minutes walk away from a subway station, making it easy to travel around the city. I would definitely stay here again."

40665346,584525956,2019-12-30,74684569,Ana Luisa,I really enjoyed my stay at Catherine's place. The flat is small and very cozy and everything there was great. It was super clean and organized and I had plenty of space for my luggage in the room. The kitchen has everything you'll need and was very clean. It's a great location with grocery stores and pubs nearby and only a 10 minutes walk to the train station. Everything was perfect.
41017306,581630932,2019-12-25,193888647,Tom,"Martin was a brilliant host. Very accommodating for our late check-in and we felt right at home with an abundance of helpful items such as travel adaptors, wifi, toiletries, staple foods etc. The location is great too and we were able to walk to St. Paul's Cathedral, The British Museum, to the River Thames and the Westend with its many theatres and musicals. Thank you!"
41017306,597007358,2020-01-24,294462034,Caren,Lovely homely apartment. Great and quick communication. Really helpful hosts.
41017306,614739505,2020-03-06,24085712,Jacqueline,"Martin and Theresa's flat is a wonderful little gem in a perfect location. Very easy to get to (I arrived via Gatwick to Victoria by train, then underground Victoria line to Green Park and change to Piccadilly line to Russel Square from where it is a 10min walk. It is also very close to King's Cross and St Pancras stations). The area feels very safe and the flat is within walking distance of many sights, shopping and theatres. The flat has everything you need and was very clean and cosy, a real home from home. It has a nice view and is light and airy due to being besides a small park and on the 6th floor of the building (no worries, there is a lift). The TV is very nice and turns into a changeable picture when not in use. It has Netflix and WiFi, but no cable for ""normal"" channels. The bed was very comfortable, if a little bit small as it's only a queen size, but the sofa bed in the living room was big enough for a 6ft 3, rugby player sized husband and 6ft wife. The kitchen has all the necessary appliances apart from a microwave, which I didn't miss. I will definitely come back and would highly recommend this flat. Communication were also very easy and Martin gave some helpful tips about the area. Thank you to Martin and Theresa for letting us stay."
41207167,604129954,2020-02-10,212400908,Ady,"We had the honour of being Bob's first Air bnb guests at the flat. Check in process was really simple and communication with Bob was easy and helpful.<br/><br/>The flat itself is beautiful. Really spacious further adding to the sense of luxury that is already present. Massive comfortable bed in a huge bedroom with loads of wardrobe space. <br/><br/>The kitchen has everything you could need. Great large living space with a separate dining area which opens out onto a lovely south facing garden. Perfect!<br/><br/>The whole place was truly relaxing yet literally 1 minute's walk from Primrose hill and Regent's park, 5-10 mins from St John's Wood and Primrose Hill shops for the essentials, the non- essentials and some great cafes and restaurants. <br/><br/>Some of our tips....<br/><br/>If you love architecture then simply wander around the streets and back streets of St John's wood. Fascinating.<br/><br/>The nearest tube stations are about 10-15 minute walk but the 274 bus (Well's Rise or Avenue Road stops) can link you with most places in London including Camden tube and Baker Street. The 274 bus stops are a minute from the flat and they run every 10 minutes. <br/><br/>We would definitely recommend Bob's flat as a place to stay and explore London."
41207167,606510985,2020-02-16,6050483,Marc,This will be your new favourite place in London. Go here. Book this. You will not be disappointed.
41207167,646915552,2020-08-05,12032824,Fanny,"Lovely, stylish garden flat in an unbeatable location steps from one of London’s most charming parks. Bob and Anthony were friendly and accommodating hosts. The bed is really comfortable and the shower is also great."
41207167,754646720,2021-05-03,12477962,Melanie,"A gorgeous, spacious and bright flat in St John’s Wood. Just a couple of minutes walk from Primrose Hill and Regents Park. <br/><br/>Location wise, you couldn’t ask for better. You can stroll along the Regents Canal in to Camden in about 20 minutes (and see the Wart Hogs and Hyenas in the Zoo on the way). Primrose Hill is literally at the end of the road with wonderful views across London. In the other direction you have St John’s Wood High Street with some great shops, delis, bars and coffee shops. You can walk to either St John’s Wood or Camden Town tube stations to get further in to town.<br/><br/>The apartment is really beautifully designed and decorated. We loved having breakfast in the conservatory overlooking the garden, with the sun shining through the blue glass. The shower is great, and a lovely deep bath. The bedroom is huge with loads of storage space. <br/><br/>We visited just after lockdown when the restaurants and pubs were only serving al fresco dining so decided to make use of Deliveroo one night and you are spoiled for choice in that area if you don’t manage to get a table for dinner. <br/><br/>Overall a wonderful stay and we will be back again once lockdown is over and we can go to the museums too. Thank you Bob!"
41207167,766169089,2021-06-04,31963412,Caroline,"Absolutely fabulous location. Flat superb, spotlessly clean and the most comfortable super king bed. Communication throughout was excellent. Would stay again in a heart beat. Truly brilliant trip, thank you Bob."

41207167,414288444956487950,2021-07-25,131739666,Julie,"I stayed the 1 night whilst visiting London and quite simply was the best place we have ever stayed in London. The flat was immaculate as reflected in the pictures, but the real surprise was the lovely private garden. <br/><br/>Primrose Hill, Regents Park and London Zoo on your doorstep and a lovely safe and upmarket area, wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.<br/><br/>Lastly our host Bob was super helpful and pleasant, a pleasure to deal with.<br/><br/>Julie and James"
41207167,419323897029226976,2021-08-01,152555472,Beulah,"My boyfriend and I booked in for two nights as a relaxing break before our baby is born and we absolutely loved our stay ! Bob was excellent at communicating quickly and efficiently. The bed was so comfortable, like a sleeping on dreamy cloud :-) the house was nice and quiet and very well equipped with everything we needed. The area was great, Primrose hill and Regent’s Park a 5 min stroll away and so many lovely restaurants and cafes we were spoilt for choice. Would definitely recommend Bob’s place and would love to go back !"
41207167,423020653838105208,2021-08-06,2750203,Taryn,We had a wonderful stay at Bobs flat. The place is thoughtfully decorated and we loved eating in the conservatory. The garden is beautiful as well. The location can not be beat. We will defiantly stay here again!
41207167,435294624229014957,2021-08-23,89461834,Amanda,"It was hard to leave, the apartment itself and the location so enjoyable! Incredible bed, very comfortable and spacious accommodation, amazed how peaceful this area is - Bob super helpful. Primrose Hill park and village, Panzers deli and the Ivy st Johns Wood, beautiful Regents Park then Marylebone High St, all easy walking distance treats."
41207167,444702744013548659,2021-09-05,13090074,Molly,My parents stayed at Bob’s flat when they were visiting for a family wedding. They had a fantastic stay - beautiful apartment in a great location (central but also peaceful and calm). Thank you!

41207167,460687585114235381,2021-09-27,8520539,Alison,"Bob's flat is a gem. The bedroom has a large and very comfortable bed and good bedding. The living room has a wonderfully long and comfortable sofa and the kitchen/sunroom is perfect to cook and dine in, looking out onto the enclosed private back garden, and there was a good quality shower in the bathroom. The flat is in a perfect location for both Primrose Hill Park and Regents Park and has nice cafes, restaurants and shops close by. We enjoyed walking into central London from here. The flat is on a quiet road in a safe area and was very peaceful and spacious. I'd strongly recommend staying here."
41207167,466475200874839232,2021-10-05,760177,Edward,"Both the bedroom and sitting areas are really spacious and comfortable. The unit is very quiet. Although the entry is below ground level (by definition as a “garden apartment”), the back of the unit has lots of windows and light with level entry out to the garden. The location is excellent - we used the St. John’s Wood tube stop (Jubilee line) to access central London - about a 15 minute walk. The shower is terrific. Our host, Bob, is extremely responsive and attentive to all needs and inquiries. All in all, we were “well pleased” and strongly recommend."

41852944,659045074,2020-08-31,52030342,Tom,James and Renata's place is beautiful. They responded quickly to all our questions. They left high-quality products for breakfast. Had a great stay overall!
41852944,668158643,2020-09-26,22314590,Jan,"Expect to stay in a comfortable, stylish and in a number of ways innovative flat in Leyton. Hosts are great and flat location allows easy access to local transport."

42109984,618417027,2020-03-15,340825100,Kuma,"After a long night out in Camden, this Airbnb served as a fantastic choice to conclude the evening. The room is overall beautiful in terms of aesthetics and smelt gorgeous, I honestly could not fault my stay at this Airbnb and to add to the experience Rami is a wonderful host, very kind and sociable.<br/>I highly recommend anyone to use this service."
42109984,658229928,2020-08-30,42635255,Hayley,"i have been using Air Bnb for several years and I have never had an experience like this. I booked the place for my Dad as he has a cat allergy and the place where I was staying (around the corner) had a cat. He had forgotten his athsma pump so was having difficulty breathing. I booked on the day as the place was on Instant book. However the host did not respond. A check in slot was given so we walked down to the property and saw the host. Initially he asked us to come back in an hour so that he could get the room ready. We were fine with that but then he changed his mind. He asked us to try to book somewhere else first before staying at his place (I had paid £70 for the night). I explained that it was already late and we were quite certain that we needed the place as my Dad (he is in his mid 50s and very underweight and has two lung conditions) was already having difficulties with his breathing and needed to rest. We were outside the house in the dark and the rain. The man was apologetic but his language was strange. He kept saying it would be 'slightly inconvenient' for him to accomodate us as he would have to open the sofa. He then changed his story and said that he had friends coming in the morning. He also explained that he was willing to refund half of the money. So he wanted £35 for rejecting paying customers at his door late at night in the dark and the rain because it would slightly inconvenience him. I explained to this man that there is the possibility of setting up his Air Bnb so that he could approve bookings before payment went through, and reminded him that he had set it up so that instant booking was possible and his room was available to book for that day. My father and I are both well travelled and neither of us have encountered behaviour like this in any country in the world. We left the property in shock. You could not pay me to stay in a building with any connection to this host, I would not feel safe. What kind of person not only turns people away at his door like this, but also wants to take money from them? I would suggest you avoid this host at all costs."
42276945,630204043,2020-06-17,247965732,Robert,"Carol is an absolutely brilliant host. Extremely hospitable and always quick to respond if you have any questions or queries. The facilities are brand new and fantastic, and the location is great - not too far from the high street and the nearest tube station. I really enjoyed my time here and I thoroughly recommend staying at Carol's place if you're thinking about it. Would definitely stay here again! 11/10."
42276945,658269970,2020-08-30,161648038,Sophia,"Carol was an amazing host and her place is great. Prior to my arrival at the location, I contacted her and she was swift to respond.

42276945,710027227,2020-11-20,201087234,Andreea,"As a person working in the five star hotel industry I can honestly say that everything was beyond five stars. The studio was spotless clean, her assistance was above and beyond and most important her house and family made me feel safe during these times. <br/>People like Carol made me remember the true purpose of using Airbnb, the unforgettable experience of culture exchange from meeting people all over the world."
42276945,725932490,2021-01-22,376307660,Fahd,"Everything was very wonderful and distinctive Cleanliness was above expected The location is very special It is away from the metro for ten minutes and close to the metro station has all the supplies you need Carol is a very wonderful person and her family also she helped me a lot in my stay with her for two months and when I had any questions she used to help me, I cannot describe to you how wonderful she is.

42744204,760567578,2021-05-21,373580714,Mark,Two minutes from the station. Easy to find. Enjoy your stay!
42744204,422234755382081616,2021-08-05,384679727,Wafaa,Hubert is very nice and the room was very nice and the house is clean. The apartment is located in a good and quiet area and nearby there are buses that take you to central London.
42744204,429440170556659866,2021-08-15,383035224,Mehmet,Thanks to Hubert for wonderful hospitality.
42744204,451245977984891191,2021-09-14,59831503,Sarah,"This was a great long-term, affordable stay option in SW London. It is just a 6 minute walk to Clapham Junction station which can get you anywhere in London in under 40 minutes. The room is a good size and there is a lot of storage space. My only issue (and this is a personal preference) was that many residents of the building tend to smoke in the hallway or outside of the bedroom window. If you are okay not having your window open, then no issue.  Also there is no laundry in the unit but plenty of laundromats nearby. Hubert was a polite host and I felt safe staying here."
42744204,452635748111476710,2021-09-16,412311059,Wojciech,Very nice place in a quiet neighbourhood 3mins walk from Clapham Junction - our stay was smooth and problem free :D
42744204,455523721340204761,2021-09-20,171626586,Elise,"Big room with plenty of storage space, nice bathroom and kitchen. Hubert was helpful when I was trying to find the flat and he left me a lot of privacy which was appreciated. Good proximity to the overground and the train to get into the heart of London in 20 minutes."

Communication was very easy.  We had no problem during check in and check out. The location has great accessibility to London Central.

44099642,636789282,2020-07-11,3808280,Guy,"“Absolutely loved my stay! The apartment was really functional, spotlessly clean, and in a perfect location. Better I would say than an equivalent hotel. A decent desk and chair meant I could work comfortably whilst having easy access to the city. Check-in was straight-forward, and all questions were answered quickly whenever required! Will be back."
44099642,644550137,2020-07-31,195250467,Lucian,"Great location, for someone looking for the basics it is a good choice."
44099642,645128664,2020-08-01,108097742,Guísela,"Had a wonderful stay at Chapter. The park outside provided a great view from the big window in the flat, but at times made it a bit noisy because of all the school children. The flat had a great study desk and chair and everything I needed in terms of kitchenware. Staff was very friendly and helpful. There is also a big supermarket nearby, which is very convenient."
44099642,646186031,2020-08-03,158475137,Christine,Take earplugs.  There is a gate that is constantly opening and closing if you have a room near reception entrance....AVOID at all costs
44099642,646664951,2020-08-04,108435197,Noam,החדר כושר היה סגור <br/>בסהכ מקום סביר ביחס למחיר <br/>להיותי מעדיף לסגור במקום יותר טוב מבחינת האיזור <br/>הרכבת רחוקה 15 דקות הליכה
44099642,647205092,2020-08-06,225268646,Grace,While I ended my stay early I have to say the customer service I received was excellent.  The room itself was in poor shape but the response after the fact was positive.
44099642,647270262,2020-08-06,10087073,Darren,"Excellent value for money, wonderful reception staff and facilities. Would highly recommend!"
44099642,648028799,2020-08-08,54453693,Arjun,"Lovely studio accomodation at the North End of Notting Hill! Is part of a student living complex, but has a 24 hour concierge, is super safe, and there's always someone there to help with anything you need!"
44099642,653045669,2020-08-18,98953263,Sandra,"I enjoyed my stay with Chapter , the place was lovely, and I was comfortable .<br/>I will definitely book again ."
44099642,656376620,2020-08-25,166018169,Kaye,"Apart from some communication issues at the beginning, I enjoyed a lovely stay. The room was clean and had all the basic necessities. The kitchenware included a pot, a pan, cooking utensils, and a kettle. The fridge is a good size for one person and includes a freezer. There is a large supermarket nearby;  just a 5-minute walk along the canal. The view of the canal was lovely and there is a nice atmosphere from the waterbirds, canal boats, neighbours, as well as the occasional live music from a nearby music studio. The windows are double-glazed and block out a lot of noise if you don’t like that sort of thing. It was quiet at night. The wifi speeds are very fast; no problems with video calls."
44099642,656893895,2020-08-27,199916463,Joshua,"Pleasant stay, very comfortable and host very responsive"
44099642,658914665,2020-08-31,140420630,Choi Ling Daisy,Fast response from the host and the room was good.<br/>The traffic was quite noisy since the room was faced to the road and was very hot in early August.
44099642,658993352,2020-08-31,24334094,Olivia,"Good option if you're looking for a cheap studio - very clean and well managed,  if basic.  Would have been good to have included a few more amenities to suit the needs of a short-term resident e.g. washing up equipment.<br/> Location is a bit out of the way."

Keine simple Hotelabfertigung braucht ihr erwarten!<br/>Informiert euch vorher über das Stadtviertel (Website hidden by Airbnb) ist relativ verkehrslastig, was man in den Räumen mitbekommt. Und es hat einen klassischen verlebten Stadtviertelcharme...also geht nicht von Luxus aus!"
44142961,646259313,2020-08-03,356762019,Melissa,Een mooie kamer op een prettige locatie van de stad.

44222506,409241143358345680,2021-07-18,29860345,Alastair,"Bekir’s place was perfect for us to explore from, seconds away from Ladbroke Grove underground it was great to be able to get to and from Portobello Road market, and a little further but within walking distance High Street Kensington. The location was great, and apart from cleaning and service fee was very reasonable cost wise compared to other Airbnb’s in the area. Being above the road it was quite noisy at night with the hustle and bustle of the high street. Perfect for a short stay to use as a base to go and explore from. <br/><br/>We don’t particularly like managed Airbnb’s where you have to go through a support team, and that was a bit of a pain to go through with differing check in guidance, but we enjoyed our stay!"
44222506,431636440381450551,2021-08-18,377373918,Jake,"Enjoyed my stay here. The road is quite loud while sleeping, but aside from that it is spacious and has good appliances.<br/><br/>Great location near the tube and good restaurants nearby. The agency service is a little challenging as it can be time consuming, but the owners who own the fish and chips downstairs offered to personally help with anything if needed which was great."
44222506,435962263911193738,2021-08-24,257861827,Kseniya,The flat was spacious and clean. It was located very close to a tube stop and right near Portobello Rd so it was very convenient to get around and see central London. We had a lovely stay.
44222506,438907760660569317,2021-08-28,245116871,Pauline,A good base in west London. A nice comfortable flat.
44222506,449038679878344511,2021-09-11,243851956,Gamal,A nice small flat that’s close to everything you need.

44222506,459907641997980586,2021-09-26,346219013,Nivia,"I stayed here for two weeks. The location was excellent for a long stay. The train and bus stops are all located on the same street as the flat. There are plenty of supermarkets and convenience stores located at a short walking distance. There are plenty of cafes, restaurants and pubs right below the flat and even a cute museum around the corner. Portobello market is a short walking distance. The management company is very responsive and solved the few issues I had right away. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it if you don’t mind the walk up the stairs. The flat’s housekeeper was kind of enough to help me with my suitcase up the stairs when I arrived and left :)"
44222506,472285860100979101,2021-10-13,132502323,Chelsea,"Bekir’s space was lovely. The apartment has lots of personal touches that make it feel very homely and neat. Communication was instant. The location is right next to a train station, which makes it easy to travel around, however, due to the fact that the place sits on a main road, it’s very noisy at night and I unfortunately struggled to sleep. I’d recommend bringing ear plugs if one is sensitive to noise."
44222506,473748523040292276,2021-10-15,3001493,Gary,Good location. Great communication and easy check in. Thanks! :)

45359496,668403897,2020-09-27,15045600,Heather,"Celia’s place is a home away from home. I felt very relaxed and comfortable here. Celia couldn’t have been more hospitable and helpful. The house is newly and very tastefully renovated and the location is close to local transport links and shops but also extremely quiet and peaceful at night time. If the weather allows, the roof terrace is a lovely place to chill out after a busy day. I had my own bathroom and could use kitchen facilities. As I was also working in London, it was a lovely pace to come home to relax in the evening. I’ll be back!!"

It's beautifully decorated, fully stocked with all the essentials and the couch and bed are SO comfortable (missing them already!) Gary and his team were super accommodating, helpful with any questions an queries I had, and even went the extra mile to upgrade the WIFI connection as I was working from 'home'. An easy walk / bus ride to East Croydon Station, getting you to London Victoria / London Bridge in under 20 mins. Highly recommend - thanks so much Gary, Irina and team!"

Auto Check-in so I don't need to worry about the flight delay, and relax in the room after long flight.  I was doing my self-quarantine here, and the studio is very cozy and bright and have everything you need. <br/>The area is nice and quiet, 10 mins walk to co-op store and 20 mins walk to big shopping mall and east croydon station which bring you easily to city centre. <br/><br/>Gary and Bianca are both very helpful, Thank you !"

It has to be made clear, however that the room I arrived to wasn’t the double en-suite I saw in photos and booked, but a non-en-suite children’s room with a single bed. The host apologised for this mixup but ignored my request to re-negotiate the price."

His also gave us his number in case of any problems.<br/>The flat was very clean and tidy, and the location is great. It’s literally a 1 min walk from the station/London Fields Park and a 10 min train ride away from Liverpool Street station.<br/>There were lots of cool bars and pubs around also and Broadway market is just on the other side of the park.<br/><br/>Will definitely book again if it’s available when visiting London."

Jim was very helpful and quick to communicate. Plenty to do locally if you don’t want to head into central London.

46639121,425163007051532430,2021-08-09,5778608,Sara,"Overall we had a really great stay in Notting Hill, the house is in the perfect location and delivers on that London city break vibe. You are literally right on Portabello Rd,  you can walk to Hyde Park, it's a quick tube into London. The kitchen is a great communal space and the beds are very comfy! A few things stopped a 5 star review and all of these are easily overcome. Firstly the house was not very clean when we arrived, I think particularly in the time of Covid you don't want to see evidence of the previous guests, there were also not enough towels for our 6 guests, I think Frances was let down by her cleaner on this occasion and did try to rectify things (a laundry package was delivered half way through our stay). There are also some broken items in the house that need to be repaired or replaced. I also think it fair to let people know that the 2 downstairs bedrooms have no windows.<br/>This all sounds bad, but I want to repeat that the location is fantastic,  and overall we did enjoy our stay."
46639121,438929032995704388,2021-08-28,15682133,Richard,"A lovely house on a lovely street. Great location and easy to get about from here. Watch out for the service fee, caught us out when we were booking.  Beds are very comfortable and spacious rooms. Sofas not comfortable at all. Lots of great coffee shops, bars and restaurants in easy walking distance. I’m sure we’ll be back. Fances was easy to communicate with and looked after us."
46688312,428058681619410821,2021-08-13,374592245,Aaron,"Adrian and Stuart's home is quite nice and they're great about sharing it. The location is both quite and convenient, about 5-10 minute walk from two different tube stations servicing different train lines. A grocery store is also a close walk."

46688312,434532582599878093,2021-08-22,95904223,Kelli,"Expect to stay in one of the most wonderfully curated dwellings you may ever have had the chance to be in! And do not be surprised, if you leave a better person than you arrived… :)<br/><br/>Adrian & Stuart are wonderfully warm Hosts. Their home is impeccably decorated, very clean and quite spacious. From the moment you enter, you will feel welcomed; like you can just be yourself & that you got exactly what you wanted from an AirBnB Rental… somewhere special - a unique experience that you will always remember - an affordable option that makes you feel like you are at home… but in a more magical kind of way. ✨"

Adrian was a wonderful host, getting back to me quickly and welcoming and helpful when we arrived. Excellent location for visiting central London with Vauxhall, and The Oval tube stations within walking distance. The River Thames is also in walking distance where you can catch a river taxi. Would highly recommend staying here and will stay again when visiting London."

The room was small but only what we needed (it is a family room and we are 4 adults so that’s our bad for being fully grown). If you also are 4 adults booking one room, please note the bunk bed is ideally for children. 8/10 sleep regardless. <br/><br/>Only small issue is with how hot the rooms were/building is. Wish it had aircon of some kind."

I couldn’t be more thankful for Tristan and his family for letting me stay at their beautiful home. It was very clean and we felt at home. I loved everything about it. <br/>The shower was amazing, The bed was so comfortable. The area was very nice and peaceful. The air was really fresh and clean as you’re opposite to a park. Despite being in a quiet residential area, you’re in the midst of Lewisham where there is everything you need and you’re close to Central London via train. Upon checking in they provided tea, coffee, and all the essentials plus some wine which was thoroughly enjoyed. The host was very polite and accommodating. 10/10 good value for £ if you’re a single traveler or couple."

Few let downs inside the apartments as half of the lights did not work, damage to walls in a few areas in living room and mould in the bathroom which weren’t shown on pictures. The apartment is in the cellar which would have been nice to know before booking. However, we did enjoy our stay. It is very spacious and was perfect for our stay visiting attractions across London. The apartment could just do with a few touch ups. Would recommend, but do bare in mind it seems like a work in progress."

There’s not a lot of cooking utensils so if you want to cook it will be difficult in terms of pots and pans, knives etc. <br/><br/>Overall it was a great stay and good value for money. Thanks so much"

We had a comfortable stay.<br/>Reasonable location, although on busy road (noisy traffic at night) and a 15 minute walk to the closest tube station. Check in was very straight forward. Lacked some basics amenities such as tea, coffee, hand soap, fresh milk so be mindful to bring your own."

49994368,439589745327819244,2021-08-29,16878350,Greg,"Booked a weekend in London, unfortunately things not go as planned, I met the host outside the building and despite having a confirmed reservation, I was informed by her that she did not have a reservation for me. Airbnb confirmed that I had a reservation from the host. Also interesting enough the host has refused to refund me the payment that I made for the room.  The only conclusion that I can draw from this, is it this host is not legitimate, I strongly encourage you to take your business elsewhere.<br/>Beware."

Well equipped, modern kitchen and the living room is more spacious than the photos suggest. Location is great, quick to get into central London and it’s lovely being so close to the common- lots of places to eat/ grab a coffee. I stayed for a month whilst waiting to move- there’s everything you need if you’re looking for a longer stay. Thanks Tom!"

50093171,439657157003791120,2021-08-29,56961621,Benjamin,"A great base for our London trip. The flat is beautifully furnished and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable, homely and relaxing. <br/><br/>The location is perfect - I made trips into central London on each of the three days we stayed, and the short walk from the flat down the high street to the tube station was very pleasant. The parks close by proved very useful for entertaining our baby, and we also enjoyed the short walk to Balham for a drink on our final night. <br/><br/>Thanks again for having us, we’ll definitely be back!"

The flat was clean, secure and well situated.Tom answered my queries within minutes and was keen to check everything was ok with my stay. I would recommend the flat to anyone for both short and long stays."
50093171,486045742194542442,2021-11-01,165653028,Ana,"Tom is a really great host. He was very responsive from the moment I booked, by answering questions I had, and during my stay to ensure everything was ok. He also allowed me to check-in earlier which I really appreciated. The flat is in a very laid back neighbourhood with good shops and restaurants, and within a 10-minute walk to Tooting Bec station on the Northern line. You can get to Central London in about 30 minutes. The apartment building is quiet and in a residential complex, which I thought was nice and welcoming. The wifi was reliable and strong enough for those who need it for work. The reason I didn't provide a perfect score was that the flat lacked a few touches here and there to make it feel homey, as I was there for almost two weeks, but that's probably just personal taste. KeyNest is used for key collection and drop-off."
50093171,491826466169202630,2021-11-09,356444329,Samantha,"This a nice little flat, especially for a shorter stay for one or two people. It’s in a quiet estate and close to transport. The internet is extremely fast. The bed was comfortable as well. The only real downside is there’s no microwave which wasn’t an issue because we mostly ate out. Overall we enjoyed our stay."

All appliances in the kitchen were new and easy to use. WiFi was easy to log on and always worked, the tv is small but Nethi did say it will be replaced soon. The location of her apartment is close to the bus stop and a 10 minute walk to Camden station and the gym.

50742932,493284293250759598,2021-11-11,427613095,Nia,"Dmity seemed like a really good host. The contact before arrival was promising, he made sure I understood about check in and allowed us to drop out bags off at 11 am so we could go do things in london before the agreed upon check in time. <br/>When we arrived the place was what was in the picture but there was a lack of up keep. There was patch works of paints that were meant to be touch ups but completely different colours, the windows in 1 room didn’t open and there was water marks on the walls and around the windows in both rooms because of the lack of upkeep we were worried about the cleaning aspect which was due to happen when we left as the guests before us had left it a mess and so to double check things like bedding was being changed we placed objects under the bottom sheet to see if they were truly being changed. In the room opposite the entrance I placed a coin under the bottom sheet and my friend put a bright orange train ticket under the other rooms bottom sheet.<br/><br/>When we returned the beds had been made up with the bedding from the previous night due to the train ticket and coin still being under the sheet. We immediately called the host expecting at least an apology and new bedding to be sent out, instead we got told firmly he uses only the best company and we were wrong and if we really had a problem with it then we can change the bedding with that already in the wardrobe in the first room. <br/><br/>We then launched into a refund request which had been rejected. I sent all the evidence as well as tried to reason saying we didn’t want the whole amount because we did stay there but had asked for the difference it would have been for 2 rooms 0.4 miles away at a premier inn where we would have know the beds were clean. <br/><br/>All in all very disappointed since it was a trip for my 21st birthday with my partner and 2 friends which was dampened by the over all experience at this Airbnb."

50861728,414989484558815594,2021-07-26,35656470,Ana Laura,"Albeit short, it was a great stay. The room is tiny but has anything you need. Everything that is described on the profile is accurate. There is enough storage space, a desk, a kitchenette, a single bed and a very tiny toilet & shower. The room was sparkling clean. I did not struggle with noice, and perhaps I would’ve liked to figure out how to open the window as it’s been some hot days in London, but nothing concerning. Honestly, I could not have asked for more. It’s a great, well-connected location with many options to eat nearby. My favourite– an Italian deli just a minute from the building."

All of my questions were addressed and host provided very helpful recommendations on top of everything. Security onsite is a huge perk and also attentive to any requests.

They both did everything they could to make sure my stay was comfortable. The room was very clean and looked much better than the photos.

He feels like family.<br/>The room is pretty large and spacious, clean, tidy and has every thing that I needed; excellent Wi-Fi connection, large wide-screen smart TV with a lovely collection of channels. The place as a whole is in a nice and calm area in south east London,  very close to public transport (bus stops are a few steps away). The kitchen and the baths are tidy and clean and well preserved and has every thing that any one might need during their stay.<br/>I would definitely come back her again if I come to London and would definitely recommend it for anyone planning to stay in London."

It has a large TV & is situated right next to the smaller bathroom in the premises. Downstairs is a lovely restaurant & a back garden area for relaxation. The area is great & about 20 minutes from the Thames by car. Mohamed greeted us straight away & escorted us into our room. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone spending time in central London."
51887238,480920559618053971,2021-10-25,114139418,Lucas,Really spacious room with a great comfortable bed. It is a shame we found it dirtier than the standards.

52349155,475112039780146096,2021-10-17,11265372,Lizzie,"The host is a good communicator and the house is attractive and well located. The tube, buses and Wimbledon mainline are all within easy reach.<br/>The house is advertised as sleeping 8. We were a party of 6. Unfortunately even 2 short on full capacity we suffered a fair number of comfort issues. Due to our schedule and length of stay we did not have an opportunity to sort most of them out with the host at the time. We have however now bought all of them to their attention privately so hopefully they can resolve them for other guests."

It's clean, nicely decorated, and well thought-out, and Dusanka and her husband are hospitable, thoughtful, and easy-going. I would highly recommend staying with them if you need a place in this area."

52713341,490415463497320710,2021-11-07,10021575,Bo,"It was literally impossible to fault Liza's house. Everything was as described. A cute little two bedroom place with easy access to trains, London and amenities. Sainsbury's and a park close by, Vauxhall station 5 mins away. Can't go wrong. <br/><br/>Stay here if: <br/>- you like to be connected to things<br/>- you like to be cosy<br/>- want two rooms for family/friends. <br/><br/>Look elsewhere if:<br/>- you want a super gentrified neighbourhood<br/>- need a big living room space <br/>- only need one room"
52713341,494066270847125183,2021-11-12,33102412,Tasneem,"Great location - so very convenient. A really cosy and comfortable home, that has been well kept and all needs taken into consideration. Despite not meeting the host in person, Liza made sure we were ok and had no concerns. Very straight forward check in. Thank you Liza"
52923655,491144805729065535,2021-11-08,4918965,Anthony,"Great spot, within walking distance to a ton of great restaurants, shops and shows! Amy was a great hostess, and was available whenever I had a question. Clean, spacious room, would stay here again.<br/><br/>Only thing that might be a real hindrance to some people (light sleepers) is the late night noise- especially Friday and Saturday, people can be outside until 3-4am."
52923655,495428517430930995,2021-11-14,31779427,Elisa,"You cannot find a better quality-price than at Amy’s place. It was very clean and furnished. Amy was very available, instructions were clear. Only comments we can make is the fact that the door cannot be locked closed (it was written in her announce) while you are sharing the airbnb with 2 other rooms of people that you don’t know. So, you are sharing the bathroom also with them. Furthermore, it’s a bit noisy by night, especially on week end, because there is an aeration whole on the window which let in the cold and noise of this very animated district so if you have a sensitive light sleep, I would not advise. But, we will come back without hesitation as her place is very well furnished and EXTREMELY well located in Soho, we really appreciate the convenience. Thank you very much Amy."
52923655,499130081617068511,2021-11-19,429514891,Annalena,The room was very cozy&clean. The location was the best possible- nearly everything you could need was not more than a few minutes away
52923655,502033723694440603,2021-11-23,29150633,Antonio,The door of this room has not key to lock. <br/>Mixer for hot and cold water  in the shower is not easy to regulate.

53017379,506323719519245205,2021-11-29,393548868,Bernadette,"This pretty property is in a truly perfect location.  Everything you might need is a short walk away yet there is no noise from traffic or the hustle  and bustle just going on around the corner.  It is opulent yet cosy and it is generously equipped for all your household needs.  Sarah is a star host indeed, and she went the extra mile for us to overcome a last-minute hitch with plans.  We enjoyed our long weekend and we hope to return next year."
53117098,501228105271650217,2021-11-22,61523627,Monte And Mollie,"This roomy flat was a great home base for my week in London, near Waterloo station and many attractions. The neighborhood offers convenient grocery stores and quiet restaurants, and kitchen is fully equipped for cooking own meals. Note that there is no lift in the building and access to flat requires a few flights of stairs. Also, you need to walk 5 minutes or so to pick up and drop off key for self check-in so not best suited if you lack mobility or have a lot of luggage. I would happily rent again!"

53622933,510698532655225551,2021-12-05,47886779,Shameel,Gregory is an absolutely amazing host! He went out of his way to show us around and make us feel comfortable throughout our stay. The apartment was stunning as well! One of the few places that looked even better in person. All amenities were provided and the apartment is in a very nice area with a car park as well. Would definitely be coming back and would recommend it to anyone.
